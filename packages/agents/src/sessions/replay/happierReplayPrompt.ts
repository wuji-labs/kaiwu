/**
 * The subset of that vocabulary replayed history must never be able to
 * reproduce verbatim.
 *
 * Reachable by construction, not in theory. A replayed turn always carries its
 * `User: ` / `Assistant: ` label, so it cannot open a line — and after the
 * container restructure exactly two untrusted values still reach column 0
 * UNLABELLED, one escaped line each: the summary, inside `<session_context>`,
 * and the pinned last user message, inside its own container. Every other
 * untrusted value renders behind a `- ` bullet or a role label. The summary is the sharper of the two: it is written by a
 * model from everything the source Agent ingested — tool results, fetched pages,
 * file contents — so a forgery needs no hostile user turn, only text that
 * reached a synopsis.
 *
 * What earns a reservation is the power to make the target ACT, so this is every
 * framer line that names a resource:
 *
 * - the native session-log sentence, which renders a bare filesystem path in the
 *   framer's voice and tells the target to read it. Forging it escalates
 *   nothing — the target already holds the user's filesystem authority and
 *   already reads this replayed content, so no boundary is crossed. It is
 *   reserved for attribution: only a path the HOST supplied may arrive
 *   introduced by the framer, because a forged one spends the target's turn on
 *   a file nobody chose;
 * - the Session-naming lines, the pointer's own and the header's predecessor
 *   session id, which say WHICH conversation the target should page. The
 *   same-Session id now rides the `<session_context>` attribute, which no
 *   untrusted value is ever given;
 * - the two native-return boundary lines, which say which rows the target's OWN
 *   conversation already covers. Forging either is the same permanent skip: the
 *   target is told it holds rows it does not, so it never asks for them;
 * - the range-bearing openings, which say which rows it already holds, which
 *   rows fall in the gap, and where the cursor starts. They carry one statement
 *   in four grammars — the claim names the span, the gap names its complement,
 *   the cursor line anchors the walk, the re-request note says the span is
 *   already inlined — so reserving one and not the others leaves the rest
 *   saying it. Their forgery makes the target skip rows forever.
 *
 * The no-range wording is reserved as well, and it was NOT the risk: it states
 * that no span was settled, so forging it can only buy the target a re-read,
 * never a skip. It is here so the pointer's column-0 vocabulary has no
 * exception to remember.
 *
 * Each entry is the line's OPENING wherever the line has one, not its whole
 * sentence, because the defang below replaces the reserved string's LAST
 * character. Reserving the opening puts the escape at the front of a forgery —
 * where the `startsWith` checks that read these lines back, and the reader's
 * eye, both meet it — instead of on a final full stop a hundred characters
 * later.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT reserved: the framer's descriptive framing — the recording
 * disclaimer, the `- Handoff:` line, `- Original agent:`, `- Predecessor
 * state:`, the reach and completeness notices, the two summary notes, the two
 * paging-semantics sentences, and the footer's `Continue from here.`. A forged copy of one of those points the target at
 * nothing, and they are ordinary enough English that reserving them would defang
 * legitimate summaries. Mangling real context to prevent nothing is the reverse
 * failure, and it costs as much as the forward one.
 *
 * Two more openings need no reservation because untrusted text cannot reach
 * them: the invocation line is indented, and every escaped channel is trimmed
 * before it is rendered, so no forgery can start with whitespace; and the
 * omission notices live in the transcript region, which no untrusted channel
 * writes a line of its own into.
 *
 * ACCEPTED BOUND: the defang matches these literals byte for byte, so one
 * homoglyph or zero-width character inside a forgery of any of them
 * leaves it whole. Recorded rather than closed, because closing it means a
 * Unicode normalisation pass over every untrusted value, and this list is an
 * attribution rule — the target already holds the authority a forgery would
 * ask it to use — not a containment boundary.

/**
 * The claim's post-condition, checked against the lines that will actually ship
 * below it.
 *
 * Four repairs have each closed one way for the claim to outlive its rows — the
 * dispatch-time fit deleting them, a fork chain's non-ascending seqs, a claim
 * sealed into a frame the fit could not reach, a span drawn across two Sessions'
 * seq spaces — and each one left another open.
 * This closes the class rather than a fourth instance: whichever step clipped,
 * dropped or reordered a row, and whether or not that step exists yet, the claim
 * is emitted only when every row it names is present BELOW it, whole, and in
 * order. Being indifferent to WHO clipped is the whole point; a check that knew
 * would have to be taught each new clipper.
 *
 * Whole matters as much as present. The builder keeps a clipped fragment of the
 * newest turn's text when that turn alone overflows the region, and a fragment
 * read as the complete message is the same permanent skip as an absent one: the
 * target is told it holds text it does not have, so it never asks for it. Each
 * named row is therefore matched by its ENTIRE rendered line, not by its
 * opening.
 *
 * In order, and each line consumed once, so two turns that render identically
 * cannot stand in for one another when only one of them survived.
 *
 * Every row the claim STRANDS, not only the rows it names. The span is one run
 * in one space and the run ends at a declared foreign row, so a row of the
 * claim's own Session lying above that break is named by nothing — while the
 * cursor the claim hands the target sits BELOW it, and paging backwards never
 * climbs. An absent row above the span is therefore the same permanent skip as
 * an absent row inside it, which is why the admission rule is the REACHABLE one:
 * a row of the claim's space is fine when its seq is at or below the cursor,
 * where the target will page to it, and otherwise only when its line is present
 * below. A row whose seq the retrieval never knew is admitted on presence alone,
 * because nothing places it relative to the cursor.
 *
 * And in ONE seq space, on BOTH sides of the match. A seq is only a number until
 * a Session is named beside it, so a row from another Session's space can
 * neither satisfy an endpoint nor prove a named row is present — matching by seq
 * alone is correct per row and ambiguous per Session, which is how a claim
 * spanning a fork chain's two spaces passed a check that agreed with it. The
 * same ambiguity reaches the LINES: every space's lines ship in one array, two
 * Sessions can render byte-identical turns, and both of this builder's drops
 * take the oldest rows first — so the copy left standing can be the foreign one.
 * Matched by text alone it answered the search for a dropped own row, and the
 * claim shipped over a row the target never received. So each rendered line
 * carries the space of the row that produced it, and only the claim's own
 * Session's lines are searched.
 *
 * It cannot check what it cannot see: rows the retrieval never fetched are
 * outside the span by construction, and a later owner that edits the sealed text
 * is past this point. `fitHappierReplaySeedWithinTotalBudget` is that owner, and
 * it holds the same invariant structurally instead — the claim sits at the head
 * of the one array both truncators slice from the tail, so it survives only when
 * the body was not trimmed at all.
 *
 * Returns the range when it verified and `null` when it did not — and `null` is
 * the wording that makes no claim, never a missing pointer. Saying nothing costs
 * the target a re-read of a tail it already holds; saying something false costs
 * it those rows forever.
 *
 * ACCEPTED BOUND: this refuses some claims that would have been true. An
 * unnumbered row cannot be placed against the cursor, so when one of the
 * pointer's own is dropped the span is refused even though every numbered row it
 * names is present. The trade runs one way only — a seeded sweep found 357 such
 * refusals, all of them that shape, and no widening — and one way is the
 * direction it is allowed to fail in.

 *

 * header — or, smaller still, returned a sliced omission notice — so the
 * provider received no conversation and no footer, and because that fragment is
 * non-empty the caller counted the seed as delivered and retired it, blanking
 * `seedText` and destroying the replay context it never sent. So the frame and
 * footer are kept whole, only transcript lines give way, and when no whole line
 * survives the seed is dropped. The sole caller treats an empty fit as an
 * UNDELIVERED seed and leaves it unsettled for the next dispatch.

 * Nothing in the frame states which transcript rows the prompt carries, and that

   * row, or a seq that does not ascend with nothing declaring why — is the
   * window contradicting itself, and picking which of its rows the pointer's
   * Session owns would be exactly the guess this claim must not make. Those
