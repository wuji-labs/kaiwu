/**
 * Typed source recipe for a configurable Replay-seeded child Session.
 *
 * Reuses the already-shared {@link SessionForkPointSchema} as the cutoff type.
 * There is no second cutoff vocabulary: `latest` and `seq/upToSeqInclusive` are
 * the only cutoffs anywhere in this feature.
 *
 * When present this is REQUIRED SEMANTICS, not an ignorable hint:
 * - source and target server/account must match in V1;
 * - the daemon resolves the source transcript and Replay seed BEFORE creating
 *   the child;
 * - failure leaves the authoring draft/chip intact and creates no child;
 * - the resolved cutoff becomes immutable child lineage.
 *
 * ATTACHMENT POINT (predecessor). This tree has no `SessionSpawnNewInputV2`.
 * The field is carried on `SessionSpawnNewInputSchema`, the `session.spawn_new`
 * Action input declared inline in `actions/actionSpecs.ts`. That schema IS
 * `.strict()`, so a daemon that predates this field rejects the whole request —
 * the same operation-scoped degradation the successor gets, not a silent strip.
 *
 * An earlier revision of this note assumed the only attachment point was
 * `SpawnDaemonSessionRequestCompatSchema` in
 * `apps/cli/src/rpc/handlers/spawnSessionOptionsContract.ts`. That schema is
 * indeed a plain `z.object` and would silently strip an unknown field, but it is
 * the daemon-local spawn contract beneath the Action owner, not the ingress the
 * authoring client sends `sourceContext` on.
 *
 * The strict Action input is the safety boundary for this carrier: it rejects
 * an undeclared recipe rather than treating it as an ignorable hint. The
 * source-context field is not a separate inspection-negotiated capability;
 * `session.continuation.inspect` remains the read-only in-place-transition
 * operation and does not authorize this spawn.
