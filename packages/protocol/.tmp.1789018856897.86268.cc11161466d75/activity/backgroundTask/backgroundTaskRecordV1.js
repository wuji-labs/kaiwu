 *   starts emitting these classifies them instead of dropping them; PLAN §4.9.2 ships no monitor
 *   row, action or schedule model, because no producer is verified.

 *
 * - **No `cwd`.** It appears in no observed Claude task payload (checked against the recorded
 *   fixtures in `apps/cli/src/backends/claude/workflows/__fixtures__/**` and the SDK's declared
 *   `SDKTaskStarted/Progress/Notification/Updated` message types). A detail view degrades to the
 *   progress line or the status alone.
 * - **No output.** `stdout`/`stderr` arrive on the originating `Bash` tool result, which is where
 *   the transcript already renders them. A second copy here would be a second authority.
 * - **No retention promise.** There is no TTL mechanism, so no field or copy may imply one.
 *
 * Liveness is NOT stored here. The in-memory provider ledger owns "is this task still running" and
 * is rebuildable; this record owns the durable outcome (PLAN §4.9).
 *
 * `.strip()` rather than the `.passthrough()` its `workflow_run.v1` sibling uses, and deliberately:
 * this record is the one place a redaction bug could persist a raw command, so the schema is a
 * chokepoint that drops anything the contract does not name instead of forwarding it.
