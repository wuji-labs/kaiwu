import type { SessionAgentTransitionCurrentViewCommittedCodeV1, SessionAgentTransitionRejectedCodeV1, SessionAgentTransitionResultV1, SessionAgentTransitionSourceStoppedCodeV1 } from './sessionAgentTransition.js';
/**
 * `SessionAgentTransitionResultV1` is a promise, not a label. `rejected`
 * guarantees `sourceEffect: 'none'` — the UI turns that into **Keep editing** —
 * and `partially_applied` with `applied: 'source_stopped'` guarantees that
 * nothing was committed, which is what makes resume-source safe.
 *
 * Those guarantees are properties of WHERE the flow is, not of the code the
 * author picked. Nine separate defects have been found and fixed one at a time
 * where an arm was returned from a state that could not honour it: a
 * `rejected('stale_selection')` after a committed cutover; a thrown fence
 * request treated as proof that no fence was applied; an already-target
 * reconcile routed back through a rejection; a reconcile reporting
 * `target_start_failed` for a target that was already running. Every one was a
 * local judgement that "this particular failure is provably pre-effect", and
 * every one was written by someone who had read the contract.
 *
 * So the contract stops being prose. The result arms are constructible ONLY
 * through the stage handle that proves the effect depth the flow has actually
 * reached, and each stage exposes exactly the arms truthful at that depth:
 *
 * | stage                          | may build                                            |
 * |--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
 * | `SourceUntouched`              | `rejected`, `outcomeUnknown`                          |
 * | `SourceFenced`                 | `rejected` (reopens the fence first), `outcomeUnknown` |
 * | `SourceStopped`                | `sourceStopped`, `outcomeUnknown`                     |
 * | `CurrentViewCommitted`         | `accepted`, `committed`                               |
 *
 * A tenth instance of the class is therefore not a review finding, a lint
 * warning or a test that must be remembered: it does not compile. Once the flow
 * holds a `SessionAgentTransitionSourceStopped`, the `rejected` method does not
 * exist on it.
 *
 * `outcomeUnknown` is available at every depth EXCEPT the last, because it
 * claims nothing and can therefore never over-promise — until the depth itself
 * is an observed fact. Once the cutover is committed, "the daemon cannot
 * establish what happened" is no longer modest, it is false: the Session
 * demonstrably IS the target, and reporting otherwise leaves the client's armed
 * switch alive in front of a switch that already happened. Every remaining
 * uncertainty at that depth is a committed-view code.
 *
 * The stage also owns the correlation `localId`, so no site can omit it from an
 * arm that carries one or pair an arm with the wrong one.
 *
 * NOTE ON SCOPE — this module encodes what the DEPTH permits. It cannot decide
 * whether a given transport/runtime failure actually reached that depth; that
 * remains domain evidence owned by the daemon (for example, which stop outcomes
 * prove the runner was never signalled). What it removes is the ability to hold
 * that judgement and still name an arm the depth forbids.
