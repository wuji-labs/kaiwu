/**
 * The one owner of how a session-activity headline is ordered and bounded.
 *
 * A "headline" is the compact, count-only live pointer a session publishes into its metadata. There
 * are two of them — `sessionWorkflowActivityHeadlineV1` and `sessionAgentActivityHeadlineV1` — and
 * the second is DERIVED from the first (PLAN §3.1), not parallel to it. Both call the functions
 * below, so a second comparator or a second cap cannot appear without deleting one of these.
 *
 * Three semantics live here, and each exists because getting it wrong is a user-visible defect:
 *
 * 1. **Active entries are never capped.** How much work is running concurrently is provider
 *    behaviour, not a Happier limit. Capping it would make a roster silently incomplete, which is
 *    the exact failure R-3 exists to prevent.
 * 2. **Only terminal history is bounded**, newest first, with the omitted count reported so a
 *    consumer knows the history is partial instead of inferring that nothing else ever happened.
 * 3. **Progress timestamps take no part in active ordering.** Active work updates constantly; an
 *    `updatedAt`-ordered active list reshuffles the badge and the popover on every progress tick,
 *    under the eyes of someone reading it. Ordering is priority first, identity as the tie-break,
 *    which makes it a *total* order — every client derives the same sequence and therefore the same
 *    primary entry.
 *
 * Deliberately generic and dependency-free: the domain supplies terminality, priority and the
 * projection, because those are vocabulary decisions. This module owns only the mechanism, and
 * knows nothing about workflows, agents, or which key a headline is published under.
