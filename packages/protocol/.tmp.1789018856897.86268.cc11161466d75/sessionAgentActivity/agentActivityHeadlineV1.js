 * producer would take the ENTIRE roster down to `null` on every client that predates it, turning a
 * forward-compatible addition into a regression for everyone else. Dropping the rows this build
 * genuinely cannot render, and keeping the ones it can, is the degrade PLAN §5.2 requires.

 * history, and reusing it for a parse failure would report a producer decision that never happened.
