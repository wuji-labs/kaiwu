/**
 * The single presentation vocabulary for "an agent is doing work" (R-6).
 *
 * Every provider/wire status enum keeps its own contract and maps into this one at a boundary
 * adapter under `./adapters/**` — none of them is replaced or deleted. Surfaces render from this
 * vocabulary and never from a provider enum, so a raw untranslated provider value can no longer
 * reach a screen.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, because each folds into a member above rather than growing the vocabulary:
 * `paused` (-> `blocked` plus a reason), `terminated` (-> `cancelled`), `expired` (-> `timedOut`),
 * `claimed` (-> `queued`), `permission_pending` / `permission_blocked` (-> `waiting`, told apart by
 * the entry's attention kind), `interrupted` (-> `cancelled`; see below). "Stale" is presentation,
 * not status: a stale entry keeps its last known non-terminal status and changes only how it is
 * drawn.
 *
 * `interrupted` — "the session died under it", as distinct from "a human stopped it" — was
 * considered on its own merits and DECLINED, because this enum is a wire and persistence contract,
 * not an internal vocabulary. It is `SessionAgentActivityEntryV1.status` in the session-metadata
 * headline and `BackgroundTaskRecordV1.status` in a durable record, and the headline reader
 * deliberately DROPS an entry it cannot parse (`keepReadableEntries`) so that one unknown member
 * cannot take a whole roster down. A released client would therefore make the agent VANISH from the
 * roster — strictly worse than the stuck row this vocabulary exists to prevent, and the opposite of
 * INV-2. Its only gain is a finer word on a row that already reads "Cancelled" with the correct
 * tone, and the fold is already ratified upstream: `normalizeClaudeActivityStatusSignal` maps the
 * provider's own `interrupted` to `cancelled`, and RULING-14 resolves a process-death cut-off the
 * same way. If the distinction is ever wanted, carry it as a REASON beside the status (the
 * presentation layer already shows a meta line) rather than as an eleventh member.
 *
 * Order is part of the contract — it is the ladder from admission to outcome, and tests pin it.

/**
 * Whether this status still claims the work is happening.
 *
 * The vocabulary owns this rather than each surface, because the answer decides whether a clock may
 * keep counting — and a clock still counting on work that is over is the same class of lie as a
 * `timeout` painted green (D-8). Two members are easy to get wrong:
 *
 * - `waiting` IS in progress. The agent has not finished; a person is the blocker, and how long it
 *   has been waiting is precisely the datum that makes someone act (4.7).
 * - `unknown` is NOT. It is the one thing an ambiguous entry certainly is not — work we can still
 *   claim is happening (4.9.3).
 *
 * **Not the negation of `isTerminalAgentActivityStatus` below**, and the gap is deliberate:
 * `unknown` answers `false` to both, because "we have no outcome" and "it is still going" are
 * different claims and an ambiguous entry supports neither. Do not "reconcile" them into one
 * predicate — that reconciliation is what would put a running clock back on an ambiguous row.
 *
 * Exhaustive by construction: a new status fails to compile here rather than defaulting either way.

/**
 * Has this entry reached an outcome we have EVIDENCE for?
 *
 * Completion is evidence-based, never time-based (PLAN §4.9.3), so `unknown` answers NO: the source
 * is ambiguous, which is not the same as finished. That matters at exactly one place today — the
 * headline bounds terminal history and leaves the rest uncapped, so calling `unknown` terminal would
 * let an ambiguous entry be dropped from the roster by a cap while it may still be working.
 *
 * Paired with `isInProgressAgentActivityStatus` above, which is NOT its negation: `unknown` answers
 * `false` to both. The two are mutually exclusive and jointly non-exhaustive, and both properties
 * are pinned by tests.
 *
 * This is also NOT the question the roster's section model answers. `resolveAgentActivitySectionId`
 * asks *where a row is drawn* and puts `unknown` under FINISHED, because an ambiguous entry must not
 * inflate what a reader believes is running. Different questions, different correct answers; do not
 * "reconcile" them.
