 *   reported `0:00`. Absent evidence of a start, the field is absent and the surface shows nothing.
 * - `updatedAt` is the instant of the most recent EVIDENCE about this entry — not the instant the
 *   producer last rebuilt it, and specifically not a launch timestamp that never advances. It feeds
