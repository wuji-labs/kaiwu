/**
 * The one owner of how a unit of agent work is named.
 *
 * `deriveAgentActivityEntries` unions the headline the CLI publishes with the entries the UI derives
 * from the transcript, and it unions them BY ID. Two spellings of one agent — `workflow_agent:wf_1:a1`
 * on the producer against `wf_1/a1` on the consumer — therefore render that agent twice, with every
 * schema valid, every test green and nothing failing loudly. That is the failure this module exists
 * to make impossible: the CLI projection and the UI merge both import these functions, so there is
 * one spelling by construction, and the hand-written literals in the test are the lock on it.
 *
 * Two separate identifiers live here, and conflating them is the subtle mistake:
 *
 * - **The entry id** is what a row is keyed by and what the headline publishes. It is namespaced by
 *   the run an agent belongs to, because a provider agent id is only unique inside its run — a
 *   recorded two-run workflow fixture labels an agent `workflow-agent:1` in BOTH of its runs.
 * - **The agent handle** is the provider-side tool-use id underneath. It is the ONLY identifier the
 *   two sides can independently produce for the same work: the CLI sees the SDK's `tool_use` id
 *   (`claudeWorkflowCorrelation.parseSubagentToolUse` → the agent's snapshot id), and the UI sees the
 *   transcript tool call whose id doubles as the sidechain id (`resolveToolTranscriptSidechainId`
 *   returns `tool.id`; `sdkToLogConverter` writes `sidechainId: toolUseId`). The UI cannot know which
 *   run the CLI attached an agent to — a plain subagent is attached to a synthesized implicit run
 *   only once a second one appears — so the merge joins on the handle and adopts the headline's id.
