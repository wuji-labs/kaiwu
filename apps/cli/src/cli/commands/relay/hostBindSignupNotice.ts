/**
 * What binding the relay beyond this computer means for who can sign up on it.
 *
 * `relay host install` binds loopback by default. `--expose`, `--lan` and
 * `--host <ip>` move it onto a network other machines share, and a relay with
 * anonymous signup enabled — the default, and what the auth docs recommend for
 * a private network — will hand an account to anyone who reaches it there.
 *
 * Information only. No policy, no default and no emitted env changes here: the
 * decision stays the operator's, and the docs page carries the alternatives.
 *
 * Decision and copy only; printing (and its colors) stay with the command.
