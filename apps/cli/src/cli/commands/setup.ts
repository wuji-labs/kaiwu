const HELP = `happier setup — connect this computer to your Kaiwu account

Usage:
  happier setup [options]

Options:
  --cloud                 Use Kaiwu Cloud without being asked
  --relay <url>           Use a relay you already run
  --this-computer         Install and use a relay on this computer
  --yes                   Ask nothing. Every step that needs no answer runs, then
                          setup stops at signing in, which has to be approved on
                          your phone or in a browser, and names the command that
                          finishes it. Needs one of --cloud/--relay/--this-computer:
                          setup never picks a relay for you. Exits non-zero,
                          because setup is unfinished until you sign in.
  --non-interactive       Change nothing. Setup says what it would need and exits
                          non-zero. Also how setup reads HAPPIER_NONINTERACTIVE=1
                          and a run with no terminal at all.
  -h, --help              Show this help

Setup asks where your relay lives, points this computer at it, and signs you in.
Your account lives on the relay you choose, so this is settled before sign-in.
