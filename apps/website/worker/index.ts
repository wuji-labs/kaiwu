/**
 * Worker entry for kaiwu.chengqiyun.com.
 *
 * The site itself is fully prerendered: every route is a real file under dist/,
 * served by the Workers static-asset layer without ever invoking this script.
 * Those requests are free and unlimited. The only thing that reaches this code
 * is /ingest/*, because `run_worker_first` in wrangler.toml names that prefix.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * First-party analytics ingest
 *
 * `/ingest/*` on this origin is forwarded to PostHog Cloud EU; nothing else on
 * the site makes a third-party request.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than pointing posthog-js at eu.i.posthog.com:
 *   - The audience is developers. EasyPrivacy (uBlock Origin's default list)
 *     blocks `*.i.posthog.com`, so a direct integration measures the slice of
 *     our market least representative of our market. That is not a rounding
 *     error on a developer tool.
 *   - The page can then truthfully say it contacts no host but kaiwu.chengqiyun.com.
 *
 * The circumvention question, answered rather than dodged: an ad blocker blocks
 * trackers because trackers track people. This one does not — no cookie, no
 * localStorage, no client identifier, no person profile, no session replay, no
 * IP retention. The signal that means "this human refuses" is Do Not Track and
 * Global Privacy Control, and those are honoured before init in
 * src/analytics/analytics.ts (posthog-js cannot honour them in cookieless mode —
 * see the note there). A proxy that recovers blocked *aggregate* measurement
 * while obeying the explicit refusal signals is a defensible line; one that also
 * ignored DNT/GPC would not be.
 *
 * NOT in the request path of anything that matters: if this fails, the site
 * still renders and the installer still downloads. Only measurement is lost.
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * This was `functions/ingest/[[path]].ts` when the site targeted Cloudflare
 * Pages. Workers static assets has no file-based function routing, so the same
 * proxy lives here behind an explicit path check instead.
