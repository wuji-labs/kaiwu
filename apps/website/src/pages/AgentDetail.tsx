 * /agents/<slug>
 *
 * The page answers one question — "does this run MY agent, on MY computer, from
 * MY phone?" — and refuses the second job it used to have, which was ranking
 * thirteen vendors against each other in a nine-column matrix. See the docblock
 * in src/data/agents.ts for why that matrix was removed rather than corrected.
 *
 * WHY THIRTEEN PAGES ARE NOT ONE PAGE THIRTEEN TIMES
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * The obvious fix for thirteen near-identical pages is to reword them. That is
 * the wrong fix: reworded identical content is still identical content, and the
 * pattern it produces is the doorway set search engines discount. So the
 * variation is carried by branches on facts that genuinely differ, each read
 * off the shipped manifest, and each changing what the reader can do:
 *
 *   lead                  authored per agent, first on the page, and now the
 *                         section that carries most of the weight: 200-350
 *                         words about what happens when KAIWU starts THIS
 *                         binary. It was one 55-120 word paragraph, which left
 *                         the page one paragraph of difference followed by five
 *                         sections of shared argument.
 *   InstallReality        four shapes, from `install.managed`/`install.manual`.
 *   RunsOnAccount         rendered for the five agents that can consume a
 *                         connected service; absent for the other eight.
 *   TerminalHandoff       three shapes, from `runtime.localControl` — see its
 *                         own docblock for the sentence it replaced.
 *   tool delivery         native MCP or the `KAIWU tools` shell bridge.
 *
 * What remains shared is shared on purpose. One app, one session list, one
 * install command — repeating that is not duplication, it is the product.
 *
 * THE SECTION HEADINGS DESCRIBE, THEY DO NOT FRAME
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * They used to be written for a reader who already knew what the page was:
 * "Claude Code in particular", "What it does", "Terminal or UI". Each named a
 * position in the argument rather than a thing the reader gets, and none of
 * them carried a noun anyone types into a search box. Someone arriving cold on
 * "gemini cli mobile app" got no purchase on any of them.
 *
 * Every heading now says what its section covers, and carries the agent's name
 * where the sentence wants one — which is most of them, because that name is
 * the search term these pages exist for. It also cuts rendered similarity
 * rather than adding to it: the headings differ per page where the template
 * used to repeat verbatim. The doorway gate in agents.test.ts is the number to
 * watch if that ever stops being true.

 *
 * The old page rendered one template on all thirteen: "Typing KAIWU {id}
 * gives you {vendor}'s own interface … and the same session is simultaneously
 * in the app." Both halves were wrong nearly everywhere.
 *
 *   • `KAIWU <id>` draws KAIWU's display, not the vendor's TUI. The shipped
 *     backends ship their own renderers — apps/cli/src/backends/claude/ui/
 *     RemoteModeDisplay.tsx, backends/codex/ui/CodexTerminalDisplay.tsx and the
 *     equivalents for the rest — and the ACP providers launch a stdio process
 *     with no TUI at all.
 *   • The vendor TUI is reached through local control, and the shipped manifest
 *     (remote-dev/packages/agents/src/manifest.ts) declares a usable strategy
 *     for exactly three: claude (:56, tmux), codex (:140, tmux) and opencode
 *     (:196, provider_attach). Kiro, Cursor and Grok declare
 *     `attachStrategy: 'unsupported'`; the other seven declare nothing.
 *   • "Simultaneously in the app" is wrong for the tmux pair as well: their
 *     topology is `exclusive`, so app messages queue while the TUI holds the
 *     session — "If you send a message from the app while Claude is locally
 *     controlled, KAIWU stores it in the pending queue first"
 *     (apps/docs/content/docs/providers/claude.mdx:32).
 *   • OpenCode is not exclusive, and the shipped docs say so outright: "the
 *     session stays writable from the app even when a terminal is attached"
 *     (apps/docs/content/docs/providers/opencode.mdx:120-127). It used to be
 *     introduced as the ONLY agent that behaves that way, which stopped being
 *     true: Claude Code's unified terminal runtime publishes `topology: 'shared'`
 *     with `remoteWritable: true` (remote-dev/apps/cli/src/backends/claude/
 *     localControl/buildClaudeAgentState.ts:31-48). What is still only true of
 *     OpenCode is that it needs no multiplexer and no setting turned on, so that
 *     is what the sentence says now.
 *   • For the ten with no strategy, `KAIWU attach` still runs — it lists what
 *     is on that computer and leaves what it cannot reattach disabled, with the
 *     reason (apps/docs/content/docs/features/attach-to-session.mdx:47-52).

                    Only call it a guide when the definition carries a real

                    `docsUrl`, and two of those are not install documentation at
                    all: Auggie's is augmentcode.com, a product homepage with no
                    install steps on it, and Kiro's is kiro.dev/docs/cli/acp/,
                    an ACP protocol page that assumes the CLI is already there —
                    on the one agent KAIWU cannot install for you. Introducing

                    sentence a reader disproves in one click.
