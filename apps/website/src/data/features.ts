 * 'upcoming' renders without the not-yet-available label.
 *
 * THE CURRENT SET. All thirty entries below were checked against the RELEASED
 * tree on 2026-08-11, and the two added on 2026-08-14 ('machines', 'surfaces')
 * were checked the same way — every one of them is in it. The riskiest four

 *   agentActions  apps/docs/content/docs/clients/mcp.mdx (the actions spec)

         * a NATIVE RETURN: it resumes its own conversation and is sent only the
         * delta since it last saw the session, not the whole history again. An
