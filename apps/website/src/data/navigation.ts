/**
 * The footer link set.
 *
 * IT LIVES IN src/data/ SO THAT IT IS TRANSLATED. It used to be a `const` inside
 * src/sections/Footer.tsx, which put twenty-two labels — three column headings
 * and nineteen links — outside every mechanism the locale lane has. The
 * extractor only reads src/data/*.ts, so they were never in the catalogue; the
 * overlay only rewrites what the extractor found, so they were never
 * translated; and the coverage report only counts ids that exist, so nothing
 * ever said they were missing. Every page on the site, in all nine languages,
 * ended in an English footer.
 *
 * Each column and each link carries an `id`. That is not decoration either:
 * walkStrings (src/i18n/overlay.ts) addresses an array element by its natural
 * key when it has one and by its INDEX when it does not, so without these ids
 * reordering the Product column would silently move nine translations onto the
 * wrong links. `id` is itself on the do-not-translate field list, so it costs a
 * translator nothing.
 *
 * Two fixes here are link-equity problems rather than taste, and both predate
 * the move:
 *   - guides.happier.dev had NO inbound link from any Happier surface. 53
 *     guides were orphaned — uncrawlable except by sitemap, and invisible to a
 *     visitor. It is the first Resources entry — and since the nav slot Guides
 *     briefly held went to Enterprise (src/sections/Nav.tsx), this link is the
 *     ONLY thing on any Happier surface pointing at those 53 pages. Removing it
 *     re-orphans the lot; it is not a taste call.
 *   - the licence file in the repo is spelled `LICENCE`; the footer pointed at
 *     `/blob/main/LICENSE`, which GitHub answers with a 404 on a case-sensitive
 *     path. Pinned to the real filename and to `MIT license` as the label, since
 *     the licence NAME is the thing a visitor is checking for.
 *
 * Third fix, same class: "Changelog" pointed at docs.happier.dev/changelog,
 * which answers 404. ./downloads.ts already exported the URL that works
 * (`/releases`) and nothing was using it. Every external URL here comes from
 * ./downloads.ts, so the link and the analytics classification in useLinkClicks
 * cannot disagree — a hand-typed href would silently land as
 * `destination: 'other'`.
 *
 * The two on-page sections are linked from Product so they are reachable from
 * every scroll position. `/agents` and `/vs/claude-code-remote-control` are real
 * routes, not fragments; `hrefFor` in Footer.tsx is what keeps the remaining
 * fragments working from a non-home page.
