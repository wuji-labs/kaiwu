/**
 * FAQ copy.
 *
 * Two jobs: kill the objections that stop a developer installing, and rank for
 * the question queries in the Semrush set — "is claude code free" (2,900),
 * "is claude code open source" (590), "how to make claude code stop asking for
 * permission" (480), "how to check claude code usage" (320).
 *
 * ("what can claude code do that cursor cant (5,400)" used to be on that list.
 * It is not in the verified Semrush set — it was the one invented number in the
 * repository, and it is removed rather than re-cited.)
 *
 * HOUSE RULE: an answer that needs a caveat gets the caveat in the same
 * paragraph, never in a footnote. A visitor who finds the caveat later on their
 * own has been sold to; a visitor who finds it here has been told.
 *
 * WORD CHOICE: "computer" is the reader's own laptop or desktop. "machine" is
 * the Kaiwu UI noun — the thing you pick in the machine selector, which may be
 * a VPS you have never touched. They are paired once, on first use, in the
 * `sleep` answer, and never used interchangeably after that.
 *
 * NO FAQPage JSON-LD. Google deprecated FAQ rich results for non-government,
 * non-health sites on 2026-05-07, so the markup buys a developer tool nothing
 * and still carries spam risk. See the structured-data comment in index.html.
 *
 * SOURCE OF TRUTH: for Kaiwu's own behaviour it is the SHIPPED CODE, never a
 * docs page. Our docs lag the product — Claude's unified terminal ships and
 * appears in none of the 225 pages, and providers/claude.mdx predates the third
 * runtime mode — so a docs anchor may support a claim but may never be the only
 * thing holding it up. For a VENDOR's behaviour (Anthropic, OpenAI) their own
 * documentation is the source of truth and is quoted with attribution.
 *
 * And the evidence lives HERE, in the comments, not in the sentence. A claim on
 * the page is stated in the product's voice; the file, the line and the quote
 * that make it true belong in a docblock beside it. An answer that cites our own
 * source material reads as though the writer had to look Kaiwu up.

         * remove it, verified in the shipped tree at
         * Kaiwu-dev/remote-dev @ cdb9408c0:
         *

         *     buildKaiwuBaseSystemPromptV1() assembles at most four blocks:
         *     SESSION_TITLE (initial or ongoing), OPTIONS, ATTACHMENTS and
         *     LINKED_WORKSPACE_FILES. The first two are conditional; the last
         *     two always ship, and they are ~90 words between them.
         *   packages/protocol/src/prompts/codingPromptBehaviorV1.ts:5-23 —
         *     the setting is `codingPromptBehaviorV1`, with
         *     `sessionTitleUpdates: 'disabled' | 'initial' | 'ongoing'`
         *     (default 'ongoing') and `responseOptions: 'agent' | 'disabled'`
         *     (default 'agent'). Those two keys are the whole switchable
         *     surface — there is no third toggle to name.
         *   apps/ui/sources/app/(app)/settings/session.tsx:36,95-130 — both are
         *     edited on the Sessions settings screen; the title control is a
         *     three-way picker, response options is a switch.
         *   apps/ui/sources/text/translations/en.ts:7750-7765 — the shipped
         *     labels, quoted here so the page and the app agree: the group is
         *     "Prompt personalization", the picker is "Session title updates"
         *     with "Never" / "At session start" / "When the task changes", and
         *     the switch is "Ask the agent to suggest reply options".
         *   apps/ui/sources/components/settings/SettingsBelowFoldSections.tsx:226-231
         *     + translations en.ts:1692,1698 — the route to it is
         *     Settings → Sessions & Behavior → Sessions.
         *
         * NAME ONLY THOSE TWO. Anything else in the base prompt is not
         * switchable, and a setting the reader cannot find is worse than no
         * setting at all.
         *
         * THE ONE CAVEAT THAT HAS TO STAY. Memory is the single shipped feature
         * that issues model turns Kaiwu asked for rather than ones you typed.
         * Verified in the v0.2.10 release artifact, not in this repository —
         * node_modules/@Kaiwu-dev/protocol/dist/memory/memorySettings.js:
         *   :219  enabled: z.boolean().default(false)  — memory is off until
         *         the reader turns it on, so the caveat costs the "No." nothing.
         *   :46-47 summarizerBackendId defaults to CLAUDE_MEMORY_SUMMARIZER_
         *         BACKEND_ID, summarizerModelId to 'default' — the summariser
         *         runs on a backend the reader has already connected. There is
         *         no Kaiwu-hosted model anywhere in the path.
         *   :56   updateMode: 'onIdle' | 'continuous', default 'onIdle'
         *   :58   maxRunsPerHour, default 12
         * Dropping this sentence made the answer read as though nothing in
         * Kaiwu ever calls a model, which is one feature short of true.
