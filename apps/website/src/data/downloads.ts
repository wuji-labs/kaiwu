/**
 * Single source of truth for every download URL and install command on the site.
 *
 * The JSON manifest beside this module is also consumed by the docs generator
 * and outbound-link checker so those surfaces cannot drift onto another release
 * channel or a stale versioned filename.
 *
 *   - DownloadBadges linked Google Play at `id=dev.happier`. That listing does
 *     not exist (HTTP 404). The real package id is `dev.happier.app`, and even
 *     that has no public store page — it is a closed testing track, reachable
 *     only through the opt-in URL below.
 *   - DownloadBadges once pinned desktop URLs to v0.2.0. Rolling releases now
 *     publish stable aliases specifically so public links never need a version bump.
 *
 * Anything that points off this site belongs here, and `yarn check:links`
 * (scripts/check-download-links.mjs) HEADs every one of them before a deploy.
