/**
 * "Where Kaiwu fits" — the positioning section, and the /vs page it feeds.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED AND WHY
 * --------------------
 * This section used to be a feature-level comparison against Claude Code Remote
 * Control. Two problems with that shape, and they are the reason it was rebuilt:
 *
 *   1. It argued on the competitor's ground. Every row invited the reader to
 *      score two products on Anthropic's axes, which is a contest a third-party
 *      client cannot win and should not enter.
 *   2. It was where the factual errors lived. Four separate claims about Remote
 *      Control were wrong — pairing was "a QR code and nothing else" (the docs
 *      list three routes), 32 was "the limit" (it is `--capacity`'s default),
 *      `--spawn` was said to give every session a worktree (it defaults to
 *      `same-dir`, and `worktree` isolates on-demand sessions only), and the
 *      price line omitted that Remote Control is a research preview that is off
 *      by default on Team and Enterprise.
 *
 * The new frame is positional rather than competitive: vendor remotes exist, they
 * are good at the thing they were built for, and each of them reaches exactly one
 * vendor's agent. Kaiwu's argument is the set of things that only make sense
 * when one client runs all thirteen.
 *
 * EVIDENCE RULE — unchanged and non-negotiable.
 *   • Every Remote Control statement is a restatement of Anthropic's own page,
 *     code.claude.com/docs/en/remote-control. Nothing is inferred, benchmarked,
 *     or characterised for quality. Verified August 2026.
 *   • Every Kaiwu statement is traceable to shipped source in remote-dev: the
 *     action specs in packages/protocol/src/actions/actionSpecs.ts, the connected
 *     services schemas in packages/protocol/src/connect, and the feature docs at
 *     kaiwu.chengqiyun.com/docs. Anchors are named inline where a claim is specific.

/**
 * What Remote Control does well, on the record.
 *
 * SHORT ON PURPOSE, and every entry now survives a read of the source page. The
 * four that did not are gone or rewritten:
 *   • "Pairing is a QR code and nothing else" → there are three connect routes,
 *     the server-mode QR is behind a spacebar press, and VS Code shows no QR.
 *   • "Up to 32 sessions" → 32 is `--capacity`'s DEFAULT, not a ceiling.
 *   • "`--spawn` gives each session its own git worktree" → `--spawn` defaults
 *     to `same-dir`; `worktree` isolates on-demand sessions, and the session
 *     pre-created at startup stays in the current directory.
 *   • "Included in a subscription you may already have" → true, with the two
 *     caveats the same page carries: research preview, and off by default on
 *     Team and Enterprise until an Owner enables it.
