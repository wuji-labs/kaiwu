 * do not ship. Nothing on this page goes near why the unified runtime was built.

That is the runtime Kaiwu uses for Claude Code by default, and for most sessions it is the right one. Claude Code’s own terminal takes the other kind of message: type while it is working and the instruction joins the work already in flight.',
    'The unified terminal runtime is how the app reaches that. Kaiwu starts the real `claude` TUI inside a shared terminal host — tmux where you have it, otherwise the zellij Kaiwu bundles — streams that terminal to every device you are signed in on, and types what you send from the app into the same composer you would have typed into yourself. One Claude Code process, one session, two keyboards on it. You can be typing in the TUI at your desk while the same session is answered from a phone, and neither end locks the other out.',

It needs tmux or the bundled zellij, so today that means macOS and Linux; on Windows the CLI tells you to use WSL2 rather than starting something it cannot verify.
