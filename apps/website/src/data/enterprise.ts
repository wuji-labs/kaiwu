/**
 * Copy for /enterprise.
 *
 * THE HIGHEST-STAKES PAGE ON THE SITE. Everything here is a claim about a
 * security control, made to a reader whose job is to check it. One capability
 * that is "in the schema but not in production" costs more credibility than
 * every other page on kaiwu.chengqiyun.com earns.
 *
 * The rule applied while writing it: a capability appears below only if it is
 * (a) documented in the shipped tree AND (b) traceable to server source. Two
 * things the README advertises were dropped for failing that test, and the
 * reasons are recorded here so nobody re-adds them from the README:
 *
 *   - "GitHub OAuth with org/TEAM membership gating". There is no team
 *     allowlist. `AUTH_GITHUB_ALLOWED_USERS` and `AUTH_GITHUB_ALLOWED_ORGS`
 *     exist; grepping apps/server/sources/app/auth/providers/github for "team"
 *     returns nothing. The page says orgs and users.
 *   - "mTLS ... via reverse proxy OR DIRECT". auth-mtls.mdx:168 says in the
 *     shipped docs: "Direct mode is not implemented yet in the open-source
 *     server; use forwarded mode for now." The page says forwarded.
 *   - "Keyless external auth for SSO-only environments". The shipped docs
 *     describe it as available, but the v0.3 tree adds an activation-closed
 *     caution telling operators to keep keyless auto-provisioning disabled in
 *     production until account-data migrations land. A control we would tell an
 *     operator not to turn on is not a control we advertise. Left off entirely.
 *   - "file transfer size limits" as a configurable policy. The server has a
 *     fixed 100MB body limit (apps/server/sources/app/api/api.ts:80); no
 *     operator-facing size policy was found. Left off.
 *
 * Verification anchors (Kaiwu-dev/Kaiwu @ v0.2, the shipped tree):
 *   signup / login policy    apps/docs/content/docs/server/auth.mdx:238-268
 *   GitHub allowlists        apps/docs/content/docs/server/auth-github.mdx:164-213
 *   OIDC allow rules         apps/docs/content/docs/server/auth-oidc.mdx:47-81
 *   mTLS identity mapping    apps/docs/content/docs/server/auth-mtls.mdx:48-73, 104-124
 *   storage policy           apps/docs/content/docs/server/encryption.mdx:25-32
 *   feature flags            apps/docs/content/docs/features/feature-flags.mdx
 *   rate limits              apps/docs/content/docs/deployment/env.mdx:196-248
 *   diagnostics access       apps/docs/content/docs/deployment/env.mdx:302-311
 *   retention                apps/docs/content/docs/server/retention.mdx:1-60
 *   Docker + databases       apps/docs/content/docs/deployment/docker.mdx:10-60,
 *                              apps/docs/content/docs/deployment/env.mdx:67-69
