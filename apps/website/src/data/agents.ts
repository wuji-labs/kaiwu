/**
 * The per-agent public record: one entry per coding agent kaiwu.chengqiyun.com markets.
 *
 * WHAT THESE PAGES ARE NOW, AND WHAT THEY DELIBERATELY STOPPED BEING
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * They used to be a capability reference: nine columns per agent — resume,
 * session listing, forking, rewind, handoff, tool delivery, attach, steering —
 * asserted against the agent registry in packages/agents.
 *
 * That job is deleted, for two reasons.
 *
 * 1. The registry this repository builds against is ahead of the released
 *    build. On 2026-08-11 the two disagreed about Grok on five cells:
 *    remote-dev/packages/agents/src/manifest.ts:479-491 declares
 *    `vendorResume: 'experimental'`, `sessionFork: unsupported/unsupported`,
 *    `sessionRollback: unsupported` and `localControl.supported: true`, while
 *    this repository's generated definition declares resume, both forks and
 *    rollback SUPPORTED and localControl absent. The shipped answer is also the
 *    one in our own documentation (apps/docs/.../providers/grok.mdx:68:
 *    "Session listing, fork, rollback, output media, and vendor-state handoff
 *    are not currently supported"). A page generated from the unreleased
 *    registry publishes four capabilities the product does not have.
 * 2. Every superlative the audit found — "the only agent that…", "the strongest
 *    …of any agent", "seven of the nine columns" — existed only because the
 *    pages were trying to rank thirteen vendors against each other. Nobody
 *    arriving from "remote claude code app" wants a ranking. They want to know
 *    whether this runs their agent, on their computer, from their phone.
 *
 * WHAT IS AUTHORED VS WHAT IS ASSERTED
 * ------------------------------------
 *   asserted against the registry   binary, vendorDocs, vendorSetupGuide,
 *                                   installKind, managedSource, and that
 *                                   `Kaiwu <id>` is a real subcommand
 *   asserted against the docs repo  KaiwuDocsPath resolves to a real .mdx
 *   authored, shape-checked only    h1, standfirst, whatItDoes, faq
 *
 * The asserted set is deliberately small and deliberately boring: an install
 * command and a setup link do not rot between releases, and both were checked
 * to be byte-identical in the released build
 * (remote-dev/packages/agents/src/providers/providerCliRuntime.ts:84-345) and
 * in this one. Nothing on an agent page claims a session capability, because a
 * session capability is exactly the kind of fact that moves under a page.
 *
 * NO COMPARATIVES. agents.test.ts fails the build on a superlative or a
 * cross-agent ranking in any authored string here. If a sentence is only
 * interesting because it beats another vendor, it is the wrong sentence.
 *
 * ON THE COUNT, AND ON WHICH REGISTRY DECIDES IT
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * The shipped registry is SHIPPED_AGENT_IDS in ./availability.ts, transcribed
 * from the released tree and cross-checked against it by availability.test.ts.
 * It is NOT this repository's generated agentIds, which is what the old guard
 * read and why four unreleased agents ended up published as though they ran.
 *
 * Every shipped id is either one of the thirteen with a page, or an entry in
 * UNLISTED_AGENTS with the reason it has none. Every id that exists only in
 * this repository is an entry in UPCOMING_AGENTS, which renders behind the
 * not-yet-available label and is counted in nothing.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES THESE THIRTEEN PAGES DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER
 * ---------------------------------------------------------
 * Thirteen pages carrying the same argument with the nouns swapped is the
 * doorway pattern, and rewording them would make it worse rather than better —
 * spun copy is still duplicate copy. So the difference is carried by facts that
 * genuinely vary per agent, each read off the shipped manifest and each
 * changing what the reader can actually do:
 *
 *   localControl      whether a vendor TUI exists to hand the session to at
 *                     all. manifest.ts declares a usable attach strategy for
 *                     three of the thirteen — claude, codex, opencode — and for
 *                     the other ten the answer is no, which is a fact about the
 *                     vendor rather than a shortfall of ours.
 *   connectedServices which credential the agent runs on. Five agents can run
 *                     on a profile you connected once; eight run on whatever
 *                     that computer is signed in with.
 *   terminalPromptInjection
 *                     whether a prompt can be typed into a live vendor terminal
 *                     rather than handed to a runner. `runtimeInput` in the
 *                     shipped manifest declares it for claude alone (:57-60),
 *                     and pi declares the inverse pair (:412-415), which is
 *                     already what pi's lead is about. It is the fact under the
 *                     Claude Unified section on /agents/claude-code.
 *   toolsDelivery     native MCP or the `Kaiwu tools` shell bridge.
 *
 * TWO AXES WERE TRIED AND ARE REJECTED
 *
 *   installKind       every agent here can be installed through Kaiwu or
 *                     found on your PATH, so which of the four shapes it takes
 *                     changes a paragraph, not a page. Still asserted against
 *                     the registry; just not an identity.
 *   topology          `exclusive` vs `shared` is a detail INSIDE local control,
 *                     and leading a page with it was misleading. Claude's
 *                     manifest topology is `exclusive`, but that describes the
 *                     default runtime only: under the unified terminal runtime
 *                     the same agent publishes `shared` with the app writable
 *                     (remote-dev/apps/cli/src/backends/claude/localControl/
 *                     buildClaudeAgentState.ts:31-48). A page-level claim built
 *                     on it would be true of a setting, not of an agent.
 *
 * ACP is not an axis either. Most backends in the shipped tree carry an ACP
 * runtime path — auggie, copilot, cursor, kilo, kimi, qwen, opencode and grok
 * all have one — so "ACP or native" would split thirteen pages on something
 * nearly every entry has. Where it is genuinely load-bearing (kiro, launched as
 * `kiro-cli acp` from the built-in ACP catalog at
 * remote-dev/packages/agents/src/acp.ts:36-47) it is an authored quirk in that
 * page's lead, which is the right weight for it.
 *
 * `lead` is the authored consequence of those facts — the first thing the page
 * says, written to be true of one agent and not of the other twelve.
 *
 * THE FOUR AXES ADDED WHEN THE LEADS GREW, AND THE COLLAPSE THAT DID NOT HAPPEN
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The four structural axes above are binary, and thirteen entries divided by a
 * handful of binaries leaves collisions: six pages — cursor, kimi,
 * github-copilot, kilo, qwen, auggie — branch identically on all of them, and
 * they were measured at 29-34% rendered similarity, the top of the table.
 *
 * When the leads had to get longer, that was the trap. Padding those six with
 * more of the shared argument would have pushed them together, and the honest
 * response to that would have been to collapse some into rows on /agents.
 *
 * The padding came from four new axes instead, none of them binary and none of
 * them shared by any two agents:
 *
 *   the launch          what Kaiwu passes the binary. `qwen --acp
 *                       --approval-mode <mode>`, `kimi --work-dir <dir> … acp`,
 *                       `auggie --acp` plus a `--permission <tool>:<policy>`
 *                       pair per published tool, `kilo acp` with an
 *                       OPENCODE_PERMISSION object in the environment,
 *                       `copilot --acp`, `cursor-agent acp`, and for grok an
 *                       update-safe stdio mode. Read from
 *                       remote-dev/apps/cli/src/backends/<id>/acp/backend.ts.
 *   the permission mode how Read-only, Safe YOLO and YOLO are expressed to THAT
 *                       agent — a vendor approval-mode flag for qwen, a
 *                       generated Kimi agent file that removes the shell and
 *                       write tools, per-tool rules for auggie, a JSON policy
 *                       object for kilo. Six agents, six mechanisms.
 *   the sign-in flow    AGENT_LOCAL_CLI_CONFIG (packages/agents/src/localCli.ts)
 *                       gives each one its own: `codex login`, `opencode auth
 *                       login`, `gemini auth`, `kiro-cli login`, a `/login`,
 *                       `/auth`, `/setup` or `/connect` typed into the running
 *                       CLI, grok's device-code variant, and for pi nothing at
 *                       all, because pi exposes no interactive login.
 *   the vendor's words  what the vendor says the CLI is for, quoted from the
 *                       vendor's own documentation rather than paraphrased.
 *
 * Measured after: rendered similarity fell from 26.4% mean / 34.0% max to
 * 21.4% / 26.8%, every pair among the six dropped 7-8 points, and each page now
 * carries 230-356 words of lead of which 94-98% of the five-word runs appear on
 * no other agent page. So nothing collapsed, and the reason it did not is a
 * measurement rather than an opinion. agents.test.ts holds both numbers as
 * ceilings and a floor, so the next agent has to earn its URL the same way.

     * ----------------------------------------------------------
     * This was a single 55-120 word paragraph. What changed it is that the
     * pages had stopped saying enough to be worth arriving at: one paragraph of
     * difference, then five sections of shared product argument.

Anthropic’s own terminal is the thing accepting the correction, and Kaiwu is holding the keyboard for you; that is a different arrangement from talking to a runner about a session, and it is the reason this page exists.',
