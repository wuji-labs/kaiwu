/**
 * /vs/codex-remote — the Codex half of the comparison pair.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM comparison.ts
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * comparison.ts owns Anthropic's Remote Control and the homepage positioning
 * section. This owns OpenAI's. They are deliberately not merged into one
 * "competitors" file: the two vendors publish different things, the evidence
 * trails are different, and a shared file is how a claim about one vendor ends
 * up being edited to match the shape of a sentence about the other.
 *
 * NAMING — READ THIS BEFORE EDITING ANY STRING BELOW.
 *   • "Codex Remote" is OpenAI's own name. learn.chatgpt.com/docs/remote is
 *     titled "Codex Remote"; the H1 on it is "Remote: Start, guide, and review
 *     coding tasks from your phone". We are citing their label, not minting one.
 *   • There is NO product called "Codex Mobile". OpenAI put Codex inside the
 *     ChatGPT mobile app. Describe it — "Codex reaches your phone through the
 *     ChatGPT app" — never christen it. A capitalised product name we invented
 *     is the single fastest way to lose a reader who uses the thing daily.
 *   • "computer" is the reader's device. "machine" is the Kaiwu UI noun.
 *
 * EVIDENCE RULE — the same one comparison.ts runs under.
 *   • Every Codex statement restates OpenAI's own published documentation:
 *     learn.chatgpt.com/docs/remote, /docs/remote-connections, /docs/cloud,
 *     /docs/cli and /docs/pricing. Fetched and verified August 2026. Nothing is
 *     inferred, benchmarked, or characterised for quality, and nothing here
 *     comes from press coverage of the May 2026 launch — several widely
 *     repeated details in that coverage are not in OpenAI's docs.
 *   • Every Kaiwu statement is traceable to SHIPPED source in remote-dev.
 *     Anchors are named inline. Nothing from the unreleased tree appears on
 *     this page in the present tense.
 *
 * WHAT MUST NOT COME BACK:
 *   • An imperative that sends the reader to the competitor ("use it", "go and
 *     set that up instead"). Conceding accurately is the job; issuing the
 *     instruction is the page arguing itself out of existence. codexRemote.test.ts
 *     fails the build on the imperative forms.
 *   • "No vendor will ship a client for a rival's CLI." False — Zed ships
 *     Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Copilot, Cursor and Pi Coding Agent as external
 *     agents over ACP (zed.dev/docs/ai/external-agents).

        'OpenAI ships a remote for Codex, and it is good. Its own documentation calls it Remote, and describes it in one line: follow progress, approve actions and send instructions from your phone, while Codex runs each task on your connected computer. Setup is a QR scan — open the ChatGPT desktop app on your Mac or Windows PC, go to Settings → Connections → “Control this Mac or PC”, approve remote access, and scan the code with a phone signed in to the same account and workspace. From then on the four things OpenAI lists are all on the phone: start tasks, guide work as it happens, approve requested actions, review the result. Codex itself is included with ChatGPT subscriptions, so for most people none of this is a new bill. If Codex is the whole of your workflow and the computer holding your code is a Mac or a Windows PC, that is a complete answer, and nothing further down this page is an argument that it is not.',
