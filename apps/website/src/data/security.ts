/**
 * Copy for /security.
 *
 * THE SECOND-HIGHEST-STAKES PAGE ON THE SITE, and the one whose reader is most
 * likely to check. /enterprise is read by someone running a security review of a
 * server they will host; this page is read by one developer deciding whether to
 * put a work session through somebody else's relay. Both of them stop reading
 * at the first sentence that is not true.
 *
 * THE RULE, same as /enterprise: a claim appears below only if it is traceable
 * to shipped source or to the shipped docs. Primitives are named because they
 * are checkable; nothing is named that was not read.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PAGE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT SAY
 *   - No certification. SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA and GDPR compliance are not
 *     claimed anywhere on it, because none is evidenced anywhere in the tree.
 *   - No audit, and no wording that implies one ("reviewed", "assessed",
 *     "verified by"). The closing section says what there is instead.
 *   - No env vars, no operator recipes. That register belongs to /enterprise and
 *     to the docs; this page is the architecture and what it means for one
 *     person. The two pages link to each other exactly once.
 *
 * VERIFICATION ANCHORS (Kaiwu-dev/Kaiwu, the shipped tree):
