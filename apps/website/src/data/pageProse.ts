/**
 * Prose lifted out of the page components by scripts/i18n-lift-jsx.mjs.
 *
 * GENERATED THE FIRST TIME, EDITED BY HAND AFTER THAT. Re-running the codemod
 * over an already-lifted page does nothing, because the prose is no longer in
 * the JSX to find — so this file is normal source from here on. Re-word a
 * sentence here, not in the component. A later run MERGES into what is here
 * rather than replacing it, and continues the numbering, so ids already carrying
 * translations keep pointing at the same sentence.
 *
 * `<1>…</1>` marks a slot: the element that wrapped that run of text in the
 * original markup, whose props live in the component and never reach a
 * translator. An EMPTY slot, `<2></2>`, is an element with nothing in it — an
 * icon, a `<br />` — and it is in the message so a translation can move it.
 * `{name}` is an interpolated value. All three are named, so a translation may
 * put them wherever the target language needs them. See src/i18n/rich.tsx.
 *
 * This is an ordinary data module, so `yarn i18n:extract` picks it up and the
 * overlay in src/i18n/siteData.ts translates it exactly like every other one.

/**
 * Copy that used to sit in a module-scope `const` inside a section component.
 *
 * THE COMPONENT IS THE ONE PLACE THE OVERLAY CANNOT REACH. `yarn i18n:extract`
 * reads src/data/*.ts and nothing else, so a label table declared next to the
 * JSX that renders it is invisible to extraction, to translation and to the
 * coverage report at once — the failure is silent in all three directions. The
 * homepage shipped its four setup steps, its three self-host cards and its four
 * explorer tabs in English in every language for exactly that reason.
 *
 * These are records rather than flat `pN` strings because each one has a shape
 * the page depends on, and an `id` gives walkStrings a natural key: reorder the
 * steps and the translations follow their step instead of sliding onto the
 * neighbour they now share an index with. The interactive halves — the CTA of a
 * step, the icon of a card, the screenshot behind a tab — stay in the component,
 * keyed by the same id. Copy here, JSX there.
