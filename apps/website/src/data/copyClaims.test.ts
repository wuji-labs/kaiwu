/**
 * Copy guards.
 *
 * These test the claims that would be most expensive to get wrong, and that a
 * future copy edit is most likely to break by accident:
 *
 *   1. The comparison table must never assert something about a competitor
 *      that isn't traceable to that competitor's own published docs. The cheap
 *      mechanical proxy for "traceable" is that every restriction row carries
 *      an explicit attribution, and that no row editorialises about quality.
 *   2. The account-pooling copy must never read as limit evasion. That framing
 *      is both a terms-of-service risk and a credibility risk, and it is the
 *      single sentence on the page most likely to drift back toward the old
 *      "sail past usage limits" wording under pressure to sound punchier.
 *
 * THE SWEEP AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS FILE READS RENDERED PAGES, NOT src/data.
 * Every guard here used to import from ./ and only from ./, which meant the
 * whole of src/sections and src/pages was unguarded — and that is where the
 * next overclaim shipped: "Four more minutes, and then it just works", an H2 on
 * the homepage, in the same family as the "Set it and forget it" line that had
 * already been removed from SelfHost for being unverifiable. A guard that reads
 * one directory protects one directory. This one renders the route table, so a
 * sentence is checked wherever it is written and however it is composed —
 * including sentences assembled from a data string plus JSX, which is where the
 * doubled article "the same a Claude subscription" came from.
 */

/**
 * Every route, rendered, with the markup reduced to the words a reader sees.
 *
 * Rendered rather than grepped, for two reasons. Grepping source would sweep
 * the comments too, and these files argue with themselves in comments — the
 * banned sentences are quoted all over them, deliberately, so nobody puts one
 * back. And a string that is only wrong once JSX has joined it to its
 * neighbours is invisible to any check that reads the string.
