/**
 * THE ROT GATE FOR /agents AND EVERY /agents/<slug> PAGE.
 *
 * kaiwu.chengqiyun.com's rule for minting a URL is that a build-time test must be able to
 * FAIL when the page drifts. This is that test.
 *
 * THE BUG IN THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS FILE
 * --------------------------------------------
 * It imported `../../../../packages/agents/src/generated/agentIds` — a path that
 * resolves INSIDE this repository, which is the UNRELEASED tree. So the guard
 * that existed to stop the site claiming things the product cannot do was
 * reading the registry that is ahead of the product. Four agents that ship in no
 * release (antigravity, ohMyPi, coderabbit, deepsec) passed it and were
 * published as though they ran.
 *
 * Everything here now measures against the RELEASED tree: SHIPPED_AGENT_IDS in
 * ./availability.ts for the set, and the released manifest and CLI runtime spec,
 * read through ./shippedTree.ts, for the per-agent facts. The unreleased
 * registry is still read — but only to work out what is UPCOMING, and an
 * upcoming agent may not appear anywhere a shipped one does.
 *
 * WHAT IS ASSERTED, AND AGAINST WHAT
 *   released registry   the id set, the binary, the subcommand, the vendor
 *                       URLs, the install path, local control, connected
 *                       services, tool delivery
 *   unreleased registry the UPCOMING set, and nothing else
 *   the docs repo       KaiwuDocsPath resolves to a real .mdx
 *   shape only          h1, standfirst, lead, whatItDoes, faq

     * are thirteen near-identical documents no matter how good the paragraphs
     * inside it are.
     *
     * THE TWO MEASUREMENTS THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN THROUGH, AND WHAT THEY DECIDED
     * ------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * First pass — removing the nine-column capability matrix and writing the
     * authored strings per agent — took the whole component from 26.9% mean /
     * 34.0% max, with cursor/kimi at the top. The note left here then said the
     * remaining floor was honest, that six pages (auggie, kilo, qwen, copilot,
     * kimi, cursor) branch identically on every structural axis, and that if
     * the number had to come down further the answer was fewer pages.
     *
     * Second pass tested that. The obvious reading of "the descriptions are too
     * short" is to pad, and padding those six with reworded product argument is
     * exactly what would have proved the note right. So the extra 200 words a
     * page came from the launch instead — the command Kaiwu runs, how a
     * permission mode is expressed to that agent, which sign-in flow the
     * provider page drives, what the vendor says the CLI is for — none of which
     * two agents share. The number went the other way:
     *
     *              mean      max
     *   before    26.36%   34.04%  (cursor/kimi)
     *   after     21.36%   26.81%  (qwen/auggie)
     *
     * Every pair among the six dropped 7-8 points. So the collapse the previous
     * note anticipated is not owed: all thirteen pages carry 230-356 words of
     * lead, and 94-98% of each page's five-word runs appear on no other agent
     * page. The ceilings below were tightened onto the new numbers, because a
     * ceiling left at the old level is a ceiling that permits the regression.
     *
     * IF THIS TEST FAILS, READ THE FIRST PARAGRAPH AGAIN. Rewording is the one
     * move that cannot fix it. Either the page has a fact the others do not, or
     * it is a card on /agents.
