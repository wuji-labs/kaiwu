/**
 * SHIPPED, UPCOMING, ABSENT — the only three states this site is allowed to
 * talk in, and the registry it measures them against.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS FILE EXISTS FOR
 * ------------------------------
 * The guard on /agents used to import
 * `../../../../packages/agents/src/generated/agentIds`. That path resolves
 * INSIDE this repository — the unreleased tree. So the test that was supposed
 * to stop the site claiming things the product cannot do was reading the very
 * registry that is ahead of the product, and four agents that exist only here
 * (antigravity, ohMyPi, coderabbit, deepsec) sailed through it. The same leak
 * put two unreleased voice modes into the FAQ.
 *
 * The fix is not a ban on mentioning unreleased work. It is three states:
 *
 *   SHIPPED   in the published release. Present tense is allowed. This is the
 *             only state that may appear in a capability table, a support
 *             matrix, or a sentence of the form "Kaiwu runs X".
 *   UPCOMING  in this repository and not in the release. Must be named as not
 *             yet available and tied to the upcoming version. Never in a table,
 *             never in the present tense, never counted in "13 agents".
 *   ABSENT    in neither. Does not appear at all.
 *
 * WHERE THE SHIPPED SET COMES FROM
 * --------------------------------
 * `SHIPPED_AGENT_IDS` below is transcribed from the released tree:
 *
 *   Kaiwu-dev/Kaiwu @ v0.2 — packages/agents/src/types.ts, `AGENT_IDS`
 *
 * It is transcribed rather than imported because a marketing site that only
 * builds when a second checkout happens to sit beside it is a worse thing than
 * a transcription. The transcription cannot rot silently: availability.test.ts
 * re-reads that file from the released tree and fails if the two disagree. When
 * the released tree is not on the machine, the test says so loudly instead of
 * passing quietly.
 *
 * Set Kaiwu_SHIPPED_TREE to point the cross-check at a checkout that is not
 * in the default sibling location.

 * under headings that already say the same thing, so the negation was the most
 * repeated one on the site while adding nothing the heading had not said. The
 * version is the part that carries information, so the version is what is left.

/**
 * The same arrangement, pointing the other way.
 *
 * UPCOMING is defined as "in the unreleased tree and not in the release", so the
 * guard needs to read the unreleased registry too. That used to be a static
 * `import ... from '../../../../packages/agents/src/generated/agentIds'`, which
 * silently assumed this site lives in the unreleased checkout. It does not
 * always: the site is promoted into the release tree to be built and deployed,
 * and there that path resolves to a file which does not exist — so `tsc` failed
 * on the marketing site because of where the marketing site happened to sit.
 *
 * Reading it off disk the way the released tree is already read removes the
 * assumption. `resolveUnreleasedTreeRoot()` tries the local repository first
 * (correct in the unreleased checkout) and the sibling `dev` next (correct in
 * the release checkout), so one implementation is right in both and the file
 * does not have to diverge between them.
