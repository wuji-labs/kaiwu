/**
 * Copy for /features/usage-limits.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS SEPARATELY FROM THE PAGE. The account-pooling scoping
 * language used to live in the homepage FAQ's terms-of-service answer, where it
 * was read by everyone including the 90% of visitors who will never link a
 * second account. It moved here because this is where a reader has self-selected
 * into needing it: they are on the usage-limits page, so they are the person
 * actually considering a pool.
 *
 * It moved as a MODULE rather than as JSX because src/data/copyClaims.test.ts
 * guards it. That guard is the reason the "sail past usage limits" framing did
 * not survive its second week, and it only works if the sentences it checks are
 * importable data. Anything that softens or relocates `SCOPE` should expect the
 * suite to go red, which is the point.
 *
 * WHAT A POOL IS SCOPED TO. A pool is keyed by CREDENTIAL, not by agent.
 * `ConnectedServiceIdSchema` (packages/protocol/src/connect/connectedServiceBindings.ts:3)
 * is `openai-codex | openai | anthropic | claude-subscription | gemini | github`,
 * and the create-pool route takes a `serviceId` from exactly that enum — the UI
 * string is "Add a fallback pool for this connected service". So a pool is a
 * pool of ACCOUNTS on one provider credential, and every agent that declares
 * that credential in `connectedServices.supportedServiceIds` can be pointed at
 * it. Copy that reads "Claude Code and Codex can pool accounts" is wrong twice
 * over: it hides OpenCode and Pi, and it implies pools are an agent feature.

    'Once the pool exists it starts with automatic fallback on, for the services that can change account inside a running session. There is a toggle on the pool — "Automatic fallback" — and turning it off leaves you a pool you switch by hand, which is a reasonable way to run it if you would rather decide each time.',
    'The defaults are deliberately unambitious. Kaiwu falls back to another member, preferring whichever has the most quota left, at most once per turn and three times per session hour, with a thirty-second cooldown in between. When a provider says a limit resets at a particular time, Kaiwu takes it at its word and does not treat that account as a candidate until then. A pool is a way to not lose twenty minutes to a re-login; it is not a rotation service, and the per-hour ceiling is there so it cannot quietly become one.',

    // for and it is NOT what this does — nothing moves while the active account
    // is healthy (selectConnectedServiceAuthGroupCandidate.ts:593). Saying so
    // plainly answers the query, corrects the expectation before someone buys a
    // second subscription for the wrong reason, and asserts nothing false.
    'People often call this load balancing. What Kaiwu does is narrower, and worth knowing before you pay for a second subscription: it does not spread work across your accounts to keep them level. Nothing moves at all while the account you are on still has room. The pool is there for the moment one runs out — the product calls it automatic fallback, and that is exactly what it is.',

 * accounts on one credential. The agent list per credential is copied straight

/**
 * Setting it up.
 *
 * THREE ERRORS HAVE SHIPPED IN THIS PARAGRAPH, AND EACH ONE WAS THE FIX FOR
 * THE LAST. That is why all three stay written down: the failure mode here is
 * not carelessness, it is the correction.
 *
 *   1. OVERCLAIM. It once said the screens, "the CLI equivalents" and the
 *      per-pool settings were all in the docs, "which is the only place that
 *      step list lives". Both halves were false.
 *   2. OVER-CORRECTION. The fix for (1) went too far the other way and said
 *      "Pools have no command-line equivalent." Also false, and false in the
 *      same way: a reader who knows the CLI checks, and stops believing the
 *      page. `parseConnectedServicesLaunchAuth` accepts `cs:group:<id>`,
 *      `cs:profile:<id>`, `cs:<serviceId>:group:<id>` and
 *      `cs:<serviceId>:profile:<id>` (apps/cli/src/cli/
 *      connectedServicesLaunchAuth.ts:19-63), so the flag does take a pool.
 *   3. THE CORRECTION'S OWN OVERCLAIM. The fix for (2) then asserted that
 *      `Kaiwu --auth cs:group:<id>` "is in the root help, beside
 *      Kaiwu --auth cs:<id>". It is not. buildRootHelpText.ts:29 prints one
 *      line for this flag — `Kaiwu --auth cs:<id>    Start with an exact
 *      Connected Services profile or pool` — and grepping that file for
 *      `cs:group:` returns nothing. The single printed line DESCRIBES both
 *      selectors; only one of them is spelled out.
 *
 * The precise truth is a split, and now a second split inside it. There is no
 * CLI that CREATES a pool — nothing under apps/cli/src/cli/commands touches an
 * auth group, and `Kaiwu connect` is described in the command manifest as
 * "Connect AI vendor API keys" — but there IS a CLI that starts a session on
 * one, and its selector is accepted without being printed. Say all of it: a
 * correction produces a false statement exactly as reliably as the overclaim
 * it is correcting.
