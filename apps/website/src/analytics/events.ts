/**
 * The complete event taxonomy for kaiwu.chengqiyun.com.
 *
 * Rules this file exists to enforce:
 *   1. Every event name on the wire is in `EVENT_NAMES`. Nothing else ships.
 *   2. Every property value that can be enumerated IS enumerated, as a union
 *      type — and where a union already exists somewhere canonical, this file
 *      imports it rather than restating it. `DesktopPlatformId` lives in
 *      src/data/downloads.ts because that is where the URLs live; an analytics
 *      copy of that list would drift the first time a platform is added, and a
 *      breakdown that silently stops matching is worse than no breakdown.
 *   3. No component calls `posthog.capture` — they call a named function here.
 *      That is what makes "what does this site actually measure?" answerable by
 *      reading one file instead of grepping twenty components.
 *      events.test.ts enforces 1 and 3.
 *
 * ONE DELIBERATE DEPARTURE FROM THE BRIEF, stated plainly.
 * The brief lists `docs_click`, `guides_click`, `github_click`, `discord_click`
 * as separate events. They are one act — a visitor leaving for a named
 * destination — and four names for one act turns every "where does traffic
 * leak?" question into a four-way union and every funnel into a manual merge.
 * So the WIRE event is one: `outbound_click { destination }`, and each of the
 * four is a one-filter insight in PostHog:
 *     outbound_click WHERE destination = 'docs'
