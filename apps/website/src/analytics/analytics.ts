/**
 * PostHog for kaiwu.chengqiyun.com.
 *
 * Posture, and why each line is what it is:
 *
 *   cookieless_mode: 'always'
 *     PostHog writes no cookie, no localStorage, no sessionStorage, no
 *     IndexedDB. Identity is a salted hash computed on PostHog's ingest servers
 *     from request attributes, with a salt that rotates daily and is never
 *     stored, so unique-visitor and session numbers still work without putting
 *     anything on the visitor's machine. This — not `persistence: 'memory'` —
 *     is what makes the consent banner unnecessary (see CONSENT.md), because
 *     ePrivacy Art. 5(3) is triggered by *storing or accessing* information on
 *     terminal equipment, and we do neither.
 *
 *     REQUIRED PROJECT SETTING: cookieless must be enabled on project 129992
 *     (Project settings -> "Cookieless server hash mode"). If it is not, PostHog
 *     DROPS every cookieless event server-side and the site looks instrumented
 *     while recording nothing. `verifyIngest()` below exists to catch that.
 *
 *   persistence: 'memory'
 *     Redundant while cookieless_mode is on, and deliberately so: if the project
 *     setting is ever flipped off, the failure mode is "we lose data", never
 *     "we silently start writing cookies on a site that promises it doesn't".
 *
 *   THE DNT / OPT-OUT TRAP (verified in posthog-js 1.414.0 source)
 *     posthog-core.js:3750 `is_capturing()` returns `true` UNCONDITIONALLY when
 *     cookieless_mode === 'always'. consent.js:39 `isOptedOut()` likewise returns
 *     `true` unconditionally, and posthog-core.js:134 defines
 *     CONSENT_COOKIELESS_WARN — "Consent opt in/out is not valid with
 *     cookieless_mode='always' and will be ignored".
 *     Consequence: `respect_dnt: true` and `posthog.opt_out_capturing()` DO
 *     NOTHING in this mode. Shipping them and claiming we honour Do Not Track
 *     would be a false statement on a page that sells privacy. So the gate is
 *     ours: `shouldCapture()` runs BEFORE init, and when it says no we never
 *     call `posthog.init` at all — the network request is never made and the
 *     lazy chunk is never fetched.
 *
 *   autocapture: false
 *     Autocapture exfiltrates the text content of every clicked element. On a
 *     one-page site it produces `$autocapture` noise instead of answers, and it
 *     is impossible to describe honestly in a privacy policy. Every event on
 *     this site is named, typed, and listed in src/analytics/events.ts.
 *
 *   the `module.slim.no-external` entrypoint
 *     Session replay, surveys, product tours and the toolbar's external loader
 *     are not merely disabled — they are not in the bundle. A reader can verify
 *     that claim with `grep -c rrweb dist/assets/*.js`. "Disabled by config" is
 *     a promise; "absent from the artifact" is a fact.
 *
 *   IP ADDRESS: `PostHogConfig.ip` is documented in @posthog/types as having no
 *     effect. The only working control is the project-level "Discard client IP
 *     data" toggle, which must be ON for project 129992. GeoIP-derived
 *     country/region survive that toggle; the raw address does not.
