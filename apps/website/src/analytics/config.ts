/**
 * Analytics wiring constants.
 *
 * The ingest region is a COMPILE-TIME CONSTANT, not an environment variable.
 *
 * The mobile app used to read its PostHog host from EXPO_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST
 * and fall back to `https://us.i.posthog.com`, while project 129992 is on
 * PostHog Cloud *EU* — so a missing env var silently shipped events to the
 * wrong continent and nothing failed. That fallback is now EU
 * (apps/ui/sources/track/tracking.ts), matching this file. The rule both ends
 * follow: the region is part of the source, and the only thing injected at
 * build time is the (public, write-only) project key.
 *
 * `INGEST_ORIGIN` is a first-party path on this origin, reverse-proxied to
 * PostHog EU by worker/index.ts. Two reasons, both load-bearing:
 *   1. The audience is developers. EasyPrivacy blocks `*.i.posthog.com`, so a
 *      direct integration measures the subset of our market least like our
 *      market.
 *   2. A first-party path means the page makes zero third-party requests. For a
 *      site whose entire pitch is sovereignty, "this page talks to nobody but
 *      kaiwu.chengqiyun.com" is a claim worth being able to make literally.
 * `UI_ORIGIN` must stay the real PostHog UI host so the "view in PostHog" links
 * and the toolbar resolve.
