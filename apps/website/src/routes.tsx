/**
 * ONE route table for the whole site.
 *
 * Before this file the route list lived inside the sitemap build plugin, which
 * is exactly the drift that plugin's own docblock warned about: the sitemap, the
 * prerenderer and the client each had to be told separately that a page existed.
 * Now they all read this. Adding a page is one entry here.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY NOT A ROUTER LIBRARY. react-router costs ~12KB gzipped and a
 * hydration-mode change to buy client-side navigation on a site where every
 * navigation is a full page load anyway. Each route is prerendered to its own
 * real file (dist/agents/index.html, …) so Cloudflare Pages serves each one as a
 * genuine 200 asset, and public/_redirects keeps its catch-all-free stance —
 * see the 40-line argument in that file, which is correct.
 *
 * HEAD TAGS. Every route owns its own <title>, description, canonical, Open
 * Graph set and JSON-LD. scripts/assert-crawlable.mjs fails the build if two
 * routes share a title, or share a page-scoped JSON-LD `@id`, which was a live
 * bug the moment a second page existed: `@id` was hardcoded to
 * `https://happier.dev/#webpage`.
