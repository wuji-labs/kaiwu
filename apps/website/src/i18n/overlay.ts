/**
 * The one walk over a data module, used by BOTH the build-time extractor and the
 * runtime overlay.
 *
 * That sharing is the whole design. If extraction and substitution each had
 * their own traversal they would drift — a key the extractor emitted that the
 * runtime looked up under a different name is a string that silently stays
 * English forever, and nothing would fail. One function, two callers, same ids.
 *
 * WHAT COUNTS AS COPY. Everything that is a string, minus a denylist of field
 * names that are identifiers, enums, URLs or asset keys. A denylist rather than
 * a marker type on purpose: marking 1,200 strings is work, and the ambiguous
 * cases are countable — `runtime.topology` on an agent is an enum while
 * `ControlRow.topology` in terminalFeature is rendered table copy, so the
 * denylist is keyed on the PATH, not the bare field name, and both are handled
 * by one entry each.
 *
 * IDS ARE STRUCTURAL, NOT POSITIONAL where it matters. An array of objects that
 * carry a natural key (`id`, `slug`, `key`) is addressed by that key, so
 * reordering AGENTS does not renumber 227 messages and re-wording a sentence
 * does not orphan its siblings. Arrays of bare strings fall back to the index,
 * which is correct for things like `lead: [p1, p2, p3]` where position IS the
 * identity.

 * guard for them, so both descended into element internals.
 *
 * Under React that was merely wrong-but-harmless — a production React element
 * is `{type, key, ref, props, $$typeof}` with no cycle, so the walk bottomed
 * out and quietly considered `props` for translation. Under Preact it is fatal:
 * a vnode carries `__`, a back-reference to its parent vnode, so the walk
 * recurses until the stack ends. That is exactly how it failed — `applyOverlay`
 * repeating down the trace with "Maximum call stack size exceeded", which reads
 * like a Preact incompatibility and is actually a missing guard that was always
 * missing.
 *
 * Detection is deliberately dependency-free — this module is bundled by
 * scripts/i18n-extract.mjs and run in plain Node, where importing a renderer
 * to call `isValidElement` would be a new failure mode rather than a check.
 *
 *   React  brands elements with `$$typeof`.
