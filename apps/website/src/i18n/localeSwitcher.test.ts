/**
 * The switcher offers TEN languages on every page, and it does not check.
 *
 * It cannot: `findRoute()` lives in src/routes.tsx, which statically imports
 * every page component and every data module, and the footer renders on all 210
 * pages — importing it there would pull the whole site into the chunk every page
 * shares and undo the bundle split. So src/components/LocaleSwitcher.tsx maps
 * over LOCALES and trusts that every route has all of them.
 *
 * This is what makes that trust safe. The moment a route narrows its `locales`,
 * the switcher starts linking to a URL the build never wrote, and this test
 * fails instead — naming the route and pointing at the component.
