/**
 * English source-of-truth copy for the marketing site.
 *
 * Every string here was lifted verbatim from the component that used to own it;
 * the file:line it came from is noted so the extraction is auditable.
 *
 * `Messages` is derived from this object (see ./index.ts), so any locale file is
 * a compile error until it is COMPLETE. That is deliberate: a half-translated
 * app screen degrades gracefully, but a half-translated landing page reads as
 * abandonware. Completeness is enforced by `tsc`, not by discipline.
 *
 * Conventions:
 * - `\n` is a hard line break the layout depends on. Translators may move it,
 *   but must keep the same number of breaks.
 * - `~~~` inside hero.subhead is a RevealText no-break marker, not copy.
 *   See src/components/RevealText.tsx. Keep it in every locale.
 * - Product nouns that ship untranslated in the app (MCP, Git, CLI, Claude Code,
 *   Codex, OpenCode, subagent, prompt, skill) stay in Latin script. This matches
 *   the app's own zh-Hans file, which writes e.g. "跨 provider 的 subagents".

     * headline and subhead in the codebase. It used to exist twice (a hardcoded
     * WordSpec array in HeroHeadline.tsx and these keys) and the two had drifted
     * into asserting different agent counts.
     *
     * THE COUNT IS LOAD-BEARING. Four agents are named; `headlineLineTwoAside`
     * carries the rest. named + aside must equal PROVIDERS.length (13), and
     * src/data/copyClaims.test.ts fails the build if it doesn't. Add a provider
     * to src/data/providers.tsx and this string has to be re-counted.

     * Line one and line two are parsed on their commas (`,` or the CJK `、`), and
     * each comma-delimited item becomes a `white-space: nowrap` group — that is
     * what keeps "Claude Code" from breaking across two lines.
