/**
 * Repo counters, read the same way downloads and Discord members are.
 *
 * Nav.tsx called `api.github.com/repos/Kaiwu-dev/Kaiwu` directly from every
 * visitor's browser. Two problems with that, and DiscordMembers already
 * documents both in its own header comment:
 *
 *   - it hands every visitor's IP to GitHub just for loading a marketing page,
 *     which is a strange thing for the page selling end-to-end encryption to do;
 *   - unauthenticated api.github.com is 60 requests/hour per IP. Behind one
 *     office NAT or one CGNAT range the star count silently disappears, and
 *     there is no way to tell that from "the repo has no stars".
 *
 * Publishing github.json next to downloads.json and discord.json fixes both.
 * The publisher that already writes those two needs one more field group:
 *
 *     { "schemaVersion": 1, "generatedAt": "…",
 *       "stars": 1445, "forks": 122, "contributors": 71 }
 *
 * Until that document exists the fallbacks below render, which is the same
 * degradation every other counter on the page has.
