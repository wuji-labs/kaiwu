 * every non-digit as a static glyph, so whichever separator the locale picks
 * simply sits between the rolling columns.
 *
 * These used to render compactly ("21.8K"). Compact notation changes the shape
 * of the string as the value moves — "21.8K" is five glyphs, "35K" is three —
 * so the digit columns would mount and unmount mid-roll instead of rolling.
 * Grouped figures keep a stable column count, and a real number reads better on
 * a marketing page than a rounded one anyway.
