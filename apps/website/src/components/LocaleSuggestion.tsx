/**
 * "This page is also in your language" — a dismissible offer, never a redirect.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT AN AUTOMATIC SWITCH, which is the obvious implementation and
 * the wrong one:
 *
 *   Googlebot crawls predominantly from US IPs sending `Accept-Language: en-US`.
 *   A `/` that redirects by language shows the crawler English and only English,
 *   so the other nine locales may never be indexed — which would defeat the
 *   entire hreflang cluster this site now emits. Google's own guidance is to
 *   serve the requested URL and let the reader choose.
 *
 *   And a reader who deliberately chose English gets thrown back into Chinese on
 *   every visit, with no obvious way out. The banner is that way out, and the
 *   footer switcher is the other one.
 *
 * NOTHING RENDERS ON THE SERVER. It returns null until an effect has run,
 * because it depends on `navigator.languages` and on localStorage, neither of
 * which exists during the prerender — and the prerendered HTML is one file
 * served to every reader of that URL from a CDN, so a guess baked into it would
 * be wrong for most of them. The first paint is therefore identical with and
 * without this component, and hydration has nothing to disagree about.
