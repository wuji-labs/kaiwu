/**
 * THE ONE PIECE OF STATE THAT GENUINELY CROSSES A PROSE BOUNDARY.
 *
 * Every other shared value on this site is a build-time constant — the locale,
 * the route, the copy — and a constant can simply be handed to each island
 * separately (src/islands/mountIslands.tsx does exactly that with the locale).
 * The theme cannot: it is written by a button in the nav and read, at the same
 * instant, by things that are nowhere near it.
 *
 *   src/components/TerminalBackground.tsx  full-viewport canvas, page root
 *   src/sections/HeroBackdrop.tsx          picks which backdrop image exists
 *   src/sections/ProviderScatter.tsx       stroke colour
 *   src/sections/CallToAction.tsx          backdrop id + overlay
 *   src/components/DownloadBadges.tsx      badge artwork variant
 *   src/components/KAIWUMark.tsx         cross-fades two logo PNGs
 *   src/components/ProviderMarkRow.tsx     mark colour
 *
 * Those sit in at least five separate islands with hundreds of lines of prose
 * between them, and React context does not cross a root boundary. `ThemeProvider`
 * in src/components/ThemeContext.tsx works today only because one `hydrateRoot`
 * call owns the entire page — it is, precisely, the context this change breaks.
 *
 * The replacement is a module-level store. Every island imports the same module,
 * so every island subscribes to the same value, and `useSyncExternalStore` gives
 * React the tearing guarantees that a hand-rolled `useState` + event listener
 * does not. `useTheme()` keeps its name and its shape, so the seven components
 * above do not change.
 *
 * TWO OF THOSE SEVEN SHOULD NOT BE HERE AT ALL. KAIWUMark and ProviderMarkRow
 * read the theme only to choose an opacity and a colour — `html.dark .x { … }`
 * expresses both, in CSS, for free, and neither component would then need to be
 * an island or ship any JavaScript. Moving them is not required for this to
 * work; it is required for the nav and the footer to stop being islands at all.

 * `<html class="dark">` IS THE STATE. localStorage is only where it is
 * remembered between visits.
 *
 * src/components/ThemeContext.tsx has it the other way round: `useState` seeded
 * from localStorage, with a `useEffect` writing the class afterwards. That
 * ordering has a bug independent of islands — the effect runs after hydration,
 * so a visitor who chose light last week is served the dark palette and watches
 * it flip once the bundle arrives. Reading the class instead makes the DOM the
 * single source of truth, which lets a synchronous inline script in index.html
 * set it before first paint (the same script that already adds `html.js`) and
 * lets every island read the settled answer with no flash and no ordering
 * between islands to get wrong.
