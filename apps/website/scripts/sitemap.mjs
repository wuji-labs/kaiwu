/**
 * Emits dist/sitemap.xml, and refuses to finish the build if the sitemap and the
 * prerendered output disagree.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS GENERATED AND NOT A FILE IN public/
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * A hand-written public/sitemap.xml is copied to dist/ verbatim and is correct
 * exactly until the day someone adds a route. Then it is wrong, silently, and
 * nothing fails — you find out from Search Console weeks later, or never. The
 * failure mode is invisible, which is the worst kind.
 *
 * WHY THE ROUTE LIST IS NO LONGER IN THIS FILE
 * --------------------------------------------
 * It used to be. A `ROUTES` array lived here, in a build plugin, while the app
 * had its own idea of what pages existed — which is precisely the drift this
 * docblock warned about. src/routes.tsx is now the single source; the manifest
 * arrives as an argument.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NO LONGER A VITE PLUGIN
 * -----------------------------------
 * It ran on the client build's `closeBundle`, which is BEFORE the prerenderer
 * writes any HTML. Its central assertion — "every route has a built page" —
 * could therefore only ever be checked against the single empty shell Vite
 * itself emitted, and would have started passing vacuously the moment a second
 * route existed. scripts/prerender.mjs calls `writeSitemap` after every file is
 * on disk, which is the only moment both assertions mean anything.
 *
 * The two things that actually go wrong, both build errors here:
 *
 *   1. A route is in the sitemap but was never prerendered → the sitemap
 *      advertises a URL that now 404s (public/404.html catches it correctly,
 *      which means Search Console reports "Submitted URL not found (404)").
 *   2. A page was prerendered but is missing from the route table → a real page
 *      that no crawler is told about.
 *
 * ADDING A ROUTE: add one entry to ROUTES in src/routes.tsx. The prerenderer
 * emits the file, this emits the sitemap line, and assert-crawlable checks the
 * result. Add a rule to public/_redirects ONLY if it needs one, and never add
 * `/* /index.html 200` — see the argument in _redirects.
 *
 * `lastmod` is intentionally the build date rather than a per-page git mtime:
 * a fabricated per-URL date is worse than an honest one, and Google largely
 * ignores lastmod it does not trust.
