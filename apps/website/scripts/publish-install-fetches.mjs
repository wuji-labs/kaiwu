/**
 * Counts installer-script fetches from Cloudflare's own request logs.
 *
 * THIS IS THE ANSWER TO "DID THE WEBSITE PRODUCE AN INSTALL?" AND IT INVOLVES
 * NO NEW COLLECTION WHATSOEVER.
 *
 * The conversion this site is built to cause happens in a terminal on a machine
 * that has no browser. The obvious way to close that loop — a source token in
 * the copied command and a beacon in install.sh — is the one thing this product
 * must not do, and the reasons are not squeamishness:
 *
 *   1. `curl … | bash` is the highest-trust act a user ever performs for us. A
 *      beacon inside it is the single most reputation-damaging line a
 *      privacy-first, open-source, E2EE product could ship, and the audience
 *      reads the script — that is why we publish it at a stable URL.
 *   2. A per-visitor token makes the copied command different for every visitor.
 *      Users paste that command into blog posts, Dockerfiles, READMEs and issue
 *      threads. The token propagates and becomes a real tracking identifier
 *      attached to third parties who never visited us. That is not audience
 *      measurement; it is tracking, and no opt-out flag makes it not that.
 *   3. It runs in CI. A beacon there measures build agents.
 *   4. It does not even close the loop. What we want to know is whether they
 *      PAIRED and SENT A MESSAGE, and both of those are already visible at the
 *      relay, which necessarily sees them to route them.
 *
 * So the chain is measured as two halves joined by a RATIO, not by an identity:
 *
 *   visit ─┐
 *          ├─ PostHog (this site)      $pageview → section_viewed → install_command_copied
 *   copy  ─┘
 *   fetch ──  THIS SCRIPT              GET /install*  (Cloudflare, already logged)
 *   run   ─┐
 *   pair  ─┤─ relay-side, server events on data the server must already hold
 *   msg   ─┘  (apps/ui/sources/track/index.ts already emits connect_attempt /
 *             message_sent from the client side of the same journey)
 *
 * `install_command_copied ÷ install fetches` and `install fetches ÷ machines
 * paired` are the two numbers that tell you where the funnel leaks. Neither
 * needs to know who anyone is. Copy-then-fetch happens within seconds on the
 * same day, so day-grain aggregates line up well enough to steer by — and a
 * ratio you can defend beats a join you cannot.
 *
 * OUTPUT: writes installs.json, to be published next to downloads.json and
 * discord.json on stats.kaiwu.chengqiyun.com (see src/components/publicStats.ts).
 *
 * ENV: CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN (Zone → Analytics → Read), CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_TAG.
