/**
 * Post-deploy smoke test for the analytics pipeline.
 *
 * There are exactly two ways kaiwu.chengqiyun.com ends up instrumented-but-recording-
 * nothing, and neither one is visible from the browser:
 *
 *   1. THE INGEST PROXY IS NOT REACHABLE. `/ingest/*` is served by the Worker
 *      script in worker/index.ts, and it only runs because wrangler.toml names
 *      that prefix in `assets.run_worker_first`. Drop the prefix from that list,
 *      or deploy without `main`, and `/ingest/*` matches no static asset, falls
 *      through to `not_found_handling`, and every event 404s in silence.
 *      (This was `functions/ingest/[[path]].ts` under Cloudflare Pages, where
 *      the equivalent trap was a project root that never found `functions/`.)
 *   2. COOKIELESS MODE IS NOT ENABLED ON PROJECT 129992. posthog-js sends the
 *      `$posthog_cookieless` sentinel distinct_id; if the project setting is off,
 *      ingestion DROPS the event and still answers HTTP 200. The wire looks
 *      perfect and nothing is stored.
 *
 * This script proves (1) mechanically and gives you the one manual step that
 * proves (2). Run it after every deploy that touches analytics.
 *
 *   node scripts/verify-analytics.mjs                  # against kaiwu.chengqiyun.com
 *   node scripts/verify-analytics.mjs http://localhost:5173
 *
 * ENV: VITE_POSTHOG_KEY (same value the build uses).
