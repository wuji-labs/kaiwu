/**
 * Fail the build when the page gets heavier than it is allowed to be.
 *
 * WHY A BUDGET AND NOT A LIGHTHOUSE SCORE
 * Core Web Vitals is a weak Google ranking signal — it is a tie-breaker between
 * pages of comparable relevance, and it has never moved a page more than a
 * position or two. Nothing in here is justified on rankings. It is justified on
 * two things that are not weak at all:
 *
 *   1. CONVERSION. This page's job is to hand an install command to a desktop
 *      browser. Every second of LCP is measured, repeatedly and across
 *      industries, as single-digit-percent bounce. The funnel already loses 44%
 *      of installs to people who open the app once for a median of 2 minutes;
 *      it cannot also lose the desktop visitors who never see the command.
 *   2. THE MOBILE EXPERIENCE OF A 24 MB ARTIFACT. Measured on Slow 4G + 4x CPU,
 *      an iPhone-class client pulled 4,167 KB and had not finished at 15 s.
 *      1,766 of the devices in the funnel are Chinese-locale, on networks where
 *      a Google Fonts round trip is not merely slow. A budget is the only thing
 *      that keeps a one-person project from re-adding a 1.4 MB screenshot.
 *
 * Everything asserted here is a STATIC property of dist/ — no browser, no
 * network, no flake. Run `node scripts/measure-page.mjs` for the real LCP/CLS
 * numbers when you want them; this is the gate.
 *
 *   node scripts/assert-perf-budget.mjs          # gate dist/

     * arrive before that page can hydrate.
