/**
 * Fail the build if a localised page links to the English one.
 *
 * THE BUG THIS EXISTS FOR. Every internal href on the site was written as the
 * bare route — `/agents`, `/security`, `/#faq` — and nothing put the locale
 * prefix back when the page was rendered for a locale. So a reader who arrived
 * on /zh-Hant and clicked anything at all landed on the English page: 566 links
 * per locale, on all 21 pages, including the nav, the footer and every call to
 * action. The translation survived exactly one page view.
 *
 * WHY A BUILD ASSERTION AND NOT A TEST. The fix is `localePath()` applied at
 * every link site, and link sites are added by anyone adding a page. A unit test
 * over the components would have to know where the links are, which is the same
 * knowledge that goes stale. This reads the ACTUAL prerendered HTML and needs to
 * know nothing: an `<a href>` that stays inside the site and does not start with
 * the page's own locale prefix is a defect, wherever it came from — JSX, a data
 * module, or a rich() slot.
 *
 * WHAT IS ALLOWED THROUGH. Absolute URLs (another origin), bare fragments (this
 * page), and links to a DIFFERENT locale — which is precisely what the footer's
 * language switcher and the suggestion banner are for, and the only place on the
 * site where crossing locales is correct.
