/**
 * Bake every route into its own real HTML file under dist/.
 *
 * kaiwu.chengqiyun.com has no router: each route in src/routes.tsx is rendered once at
 * build time and written to dist/<route>/index.html, so Cloudflare Pages serves
 * it as a genuine 200 asset. public/_redirects deliberately has no
 * `/* /index.html 200` catch-all — see the argument in that file — and this
 * script is what makes that stance work for more than one page.
 *
 * Without this step every emitted file is ~1.5KB ending in
 * `<div id="root"></div>` and the site has zero crawlable words. With it each
 * file carries its own text, its own <title>, its own canonical and its own
 * JSON-LD, and hydrates over the markup.
 *
 * IT ALSO CHOOSES WHICH CODE EACH PAGE LOADS. The client build emits one entry
 * per prerendered page (src/entries/, wired up in vite.config.ts), so the single
 * <script type="module"> Vite leaves in the shell is not the right script for
 * any of them. Each file gets its route's entry instead, read out of
 * dist/.vite/manifest.json, plus modulepreloads for the chunks that entry
 * statically imports. That is what stops a reader of /security downloading the
 * copy for the other twenty pages.
 *
 * Run after BOTH builds:
 *   vite build
 *   vite build --ssr src/entry-server.tsx
 *   node scripts/prerender.mjs
