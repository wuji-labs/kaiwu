 * KB gzip, 27% of it site copy — because index.html loaded one entry
 * (src/main.tsx) that reached src/routes.tsx, and the route table imports every
 * page component there is. React needs that same data to hydrate, so a reader of
 * /security downloaded the copy for twenty pages they will never open.
 *
 * Each file in src/entries/ is now its own entry, naming exactly one page. This
 * function does NOT know the route table, the locale list, or how many pages
 * there are: it reads the directory. src/entry-server.tsx computes which entry
 * each (route, locale) pair needs, and scripts/prerender.mjs fails the build
 * naming the missing file if the two disagree — so a new route or a new locale
 * cannot silently ship an un-hydrated page, and nothing here has to be counted.
 *
 * Files beginning with `_` are the shared halves (_mount.tsx, _agent.tsx) rather
 * than pages, so they are skipped as inputs; Rollup still emits them, once, as
 * chunks the entries that need them share.
