  /**
   * docs.happier.dev is a fully static export served by Cloudflare Workers.
   *
   * WHY EXPORT AND NOT THE OPENNEXT ADAPTER. Every page is content known at
   * build time. The only route that genuinely needs a server is /ingest/* (the
   * analytics proxy), which is now the Worker script in worker/index.ts. Exporting makes the pages static assets: free and
   * unlimited on the Workers asset layer, with no invocation per page view.
   * `@opennextjs/cloudflare` would have preserved SSR semantics nothing here
   * uses, and its peer range (`next >=16.2.11`) does not admit the version this
   * app is pinned to anyway.
   *
   * WHAT MOVED OUT OF THIS FILE, AND WHY IT CANNOT COME BACK:
   *   - `redirects()` — 160 permanent URL moves. Export drops the hook SILENTLY,
   *     so they live in redirects.mjs and are compiled to public/_redirects by
   *     scripts/generateRedirects.mjs on every build. Adding a `redirects()` key
   *     here again would work in `next dev` and do nothing in production.
   *   - `rewrites()` — `/:path*.mdx` served the plain-text source of a page.
   *     There is no rewrite any more, at any layer: scripts/exportMdxSources.mjs
   *     MOVES each exported source onto the URL it is served at, so `<page>.mdx`
   *     is a static file. A rewrite would have cost a Worker invocation per
   *     request to do what a rename does once per build.
   *
   * Route handlers must also be statically renderable (`force-static`, GET
   * only) — see the notes on each one under src/app.
