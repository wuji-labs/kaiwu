/**
 * Renders the "Get the apps" page from the website's download manifest.
 *
 * Nothing on the documentation site told a reader where to get the app. Zero
 * hits for `apps.apple.com`, zero for the APK, zero for the desktop build — on
 * a 125-page site whose first section is called Getting started. Meanwhile
 * `apps/website/src/data/downloads.ts` already held every URL, was already the
 * single source of truth for the marketing site, and already had a link checker
 * (`yarn --cwd apps/website check:links`) HEADing all of them before deploy.
 *
 * So this page is generated from the website download manifest rather than retyped. The alternative
 * is two hand-maintained copies of the same URLs, which is how the website ended
 * up with three dead links in the first place — the exact history its own
 * docblock records.
 *
 * The Android situation is deliberately not smoothed over. There is no public
 * Play listing; `ANDROID_PLAY_URL` 404s for everyone, and the manifest says in
 * as many words not to ship it. The APK is what Android users actually use, so
 * that is what this page leads with.

title: Get the apps
description: Where to download Kaiwu for iPhone, Android, desktop and the browser, and which one to start with.
---

Kaiwu runs your coding agents on a computer you control and gives you a way to
drive them from somewhere else. So you need two things: the CLI on the machine
that will do the work, and a client to drive it from.

Start with the client. You cannot finish the CLI's login without one — the
terminal prints a code for a browser or phone you are already signed in on.

## On your phone

<Cards>
  <Card title="iPhone and iPad" href="${m.appStore}" description="Kaiwu on the App Store." />
  <Card title="Android (APK)" href="${m.androidApk}" description="Direct download. There is no public Play listing yet." />
</Cards>

Android is worth a sentence of explanation. There is no public Google Play
listing today — the Play track is closed testing, so the store page returns
"not found" unless your Google account is already on the tester list. The APK
above is a direct download and is how most Android users are running Kaiwu.
If you would rather go through Play, you can [join the testing
programme](${m.androidOptIn}) first; the store page starts working for your
account once you have.

## In a browser

[${m.webApp.replace(/^https?:\/\//, '').replace(/\/$/, '')}](${m.webApp}) is the
full client — no install, and the fastest way to see whether Kaiwu suits you.
It is also the easiest place to complete the CLI login, because you are probably
already signed in to a browser on the machine you are setting up.

## On your desktop

The desktop app adds things a browser tab cannot do: it can install and manage
the background service for you, and it keeps a window and tray presence when the
session is running somewhere else.

| Platform | Download |
| --- | --- |
${desktopRows}

These stable links always resolve to the current release. Every immutable build
is listed on the [releases page](${m.desktopReleases}) if you need an older one
or a different architecture.

## On the machine that runs your agents

This is the part that does the work, and it is a CLI rather than an app:

\`\`\`bash
${m.installUnix}
\`\`\`

On Windows, in PowerShell:

\`\`\`powershell
${m.installWindows}
\`\`\`

The installer verifies every release signature before unpacking. See
[CLI](/apps/cli) for the other install routes, release channels, and what to
do when the command is not found afterwards.
