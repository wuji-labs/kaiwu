/**
 * Content guardrails that run before the Next build.
 *
 * Both checks exist because of defects that shipped and stayed shipped for
 * months, invisible to every other check in the repository:
 *
 *   1. Every `./name` link written inside a section's `index.mdx` was a hard
 *      404. `baseUrl` is `''`, so a section index lives at `/features` with no
 *      trailing slash and the browser resolves `./git` against `/`. Fumadocs'
 *      `createRelativeLink` would normally rewrite it, but only when
 *      `getPageByHref` finds the target — and that lookup is keyed by file path
 *      *with* the `.mdx` extension, which none of the site's relative links
 *      carried. So it silently no-opped on exactly the pages where it mattered.
 *      Leaf pages were unaffected, the sidebar reached every page, and the
 *      build stayed green. Forty of the forty links on the Features landing
 *      page were dead.
 *
 *   2. Sixteen pages sent readers to "Settings → AI provider settings", a menu
 *      item that existed for one day in February 2026 before being renamed. The
 *      docs cannot see `en.ts`, so nothing connected the rename to the pages
 *      describing it. Same shape as "Take over + Sync", "Server settings",
 *      "Resume ID", and the Git toggle labels.
 *
 * The rule both encode: a documented navigation path is a claim about a string
 * that exists somewhere else, and claims need checking.

 * A documented navigation path names strings the app actually renders.

 * arrow notation — an ElevenLabs API-key permission (`Voices → Read`), a form
 * field and its option (`Applies to → One machine`), a SwiftBar menu
 * (`Components → Git cache`) — is a claim about a different UI that this check
 * has no way to adjudicate, and guessing there produces noise that trains
 * people to ignore the failure.
