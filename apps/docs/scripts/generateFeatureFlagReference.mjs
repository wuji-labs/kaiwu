/**
 * Renders the feature-flag reference from the protocol catalog and the client
 * registry.
 *
 * The hand-written page documented 3 of 71 flags. That is not a gap anyone
 * could have closed by hand and kept closed: the flags that decide whether
 * session folders, agent goals, action approvals, the pending queue, the
 * unified terminal or account pools exist at all were all missing, and a
 * self-hoster had no way to discover them.
 *
 * Sources:
 *   - `@happier-dev/protocol`'s `FEATURE_CATALOG` — the 71 canonical ids, their
 *     descriptions, whether the server or the client owns them, and their
 *     dependencies. Imported from the built package.
 *   - `apps/ui/.../uiFeatureRegistry.ts` — which of those the app exposes as a
 *     user-facing toggle, and whether it is experimental and on by default.
 *     Parsed from source because the client is not importable from a plain Node
 *     script; `collectUiToggles` asserts it found all 71 ids, so a shape change
 *     fails here rather than silently publishing a short list.
 *
 * Regenerate with `yarn --cwd apps/docs generate:reference`.

title: Feature flags
description: Every capability Kaiwu can gate, who controls it, and what it defaults to — generated from the feature catalog.
---

Not everything Kaiwu can do is switched on for everybody. A capability can be
gated in three places, and a feature is only usable when all three agree:

1. **The server** advertises which features it supports. Self-hosters control
   this with \`HAPPIER_FEATURE_*\` environment variables; on Kaiwu Cloud it is
   set for you.
2. **The build** can deny features regardless of the server, through
   \`HAPPIER_BUILD_FEATURES_ALLOW\` and \`HAPPIER_BUILD_FEATURES_DENY\`.
3. **You** turn some of them on in **Settings → Features**.

Every feature in the catalog is **fail-closed**: if the client cannot get a
clear answer about whether a feature is available, it treats it as unavailable.
That is why a feature can seem to vanish when a server is unreachable, and why
a misconfigured self-hosted server hides features rather than half-enabling them.

There are ${ids.length} features in the catalog. ${userToggles.length} of them have a switch you can
reach; the other ${serverOnly.length} are decided before you get there.

## Features you can turn on yourself

These appear in **Settings → Features**. ${experimentalCount} of the ${userToggles.length} are marked experimental.

${table(['Feature', 'Id', 'Kind', 'Default'], userRows)}

Experimental toggles are hidden until you turn on the experiments switch at the
top of that screen. If a page tells you to enable something here and you cannot
find the row, that switch is almost always why.

A toggle only offers what the server already allows. Turning something on
locally cannot enable a feature the server has not advertised.

## Features the server decides

These have no user-facing switch. A self-hoster sets them through the
environment; on Kaiwu Cloud they are managed for you. \`server\` means the
server owns the decision outright; \`client\` means the client owns the
behaviour but still needs the server to advertise the capability.

${table(['Id', 'What it gates', 'Owned by', 'Depends on'], serverRows)}

Where a feature depends on another, both must be enabled — enabling the
dependant alone does nothing.
