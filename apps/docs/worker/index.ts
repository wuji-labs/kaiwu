/**
 * Worker entry for kaiwu.chengqiyun.com/docs.
 *
 * The site is a fully static Next export: every page is a real file under out/,
 * served by the Workers static-asset layer without ever invoking this script.
 * Those requests are free and unlimited. ONE path reaches this code — /ingest/*,
 * named in `run_worker_first` in wrangler.toml — and it is the only billable
 * invocation the site can produce.
 *
 * Two other paths used to live here and deliberately no longer do:
 *
 *   *.mdx     was a Worker rewrite onto the exported source. The sources are
 *             now MOVED to those URLs at build time (scripts/exportMdxSources.mjs),
 *             so they are plain static assets and cost nothing to serve.
 *   /health   reported liveness of this script. Nothing consumed it — the
 *             deploy job already asserts the artifact is real — and a monitor
 *             polling it every 60s would have spent 1,440 free-tier requests a
 *             day to learn what the deploy already proved.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * First-party analytics ingest
 *
 * `/ingest/*` is forwarded to PostHog Cloud EU; nothing else on the site makes
 * a third-party request.
 *
 * Why this exists rather than pointing posthog-js at eu.i.posthog.com:
 *   - The audience is developers. EasyPrivacy (uBlock Origin's default list)
 *     blocks `*.i.posthog.com`, so a direct integration measures the slice of
 *     our readership least like our readership.
 *   - With the proxy, the page can truthfully say it contacts no host but this
 *     one — which is the claim the privacy policy makes.
 *
 * The circumvention question, answered rather than dodged: an ad blocker blocks
 * trackers because trackers track people. This one does not — no cookie, no
 * stored id, no person profile, no session replay, no IP retention. The signal
 * that means "this human refuses" is Global Privacy Control, and it is honoured
 * before posthog-js is imported at all (src/analytics/analytics.ts).
 *
 * NOT in the request path of anything that matters: if this fails the docs
 * still render. Only measurement is lost.
