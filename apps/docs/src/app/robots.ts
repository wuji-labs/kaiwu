 * The `sitemap` value is ABSOLUTE on purpose. A relative `/sitemap.xml` is
 * invalid per the sitemaps.org spec and is discarded silently — the file looks
 * right, the crawler ignores it, and nothing anywhere reports the miss.
 *
 * No `host` directive: it is a Yandex extension every other crawler ignores,
 * and Next emits it as a full URL (`Host: https://kaiwu.chengqiyun.com/docs`) where the
 * directive wants a bare hostname. A line that is wrong and ignored is worse
 * than no line.
 *
 * `/api/` is disallowed because the only thing under it is the search index —
 * a 14 MB serialized blob that is data for the search box, not a page. Nothing
 * is hidden by this; it just keeps a crawler from spending its budget on it.
