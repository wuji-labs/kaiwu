 * for two reasons that survive that: Bing does not ignore it, and the table
 * below is the only place in the repo that states, in one screen, which parts

 * are contributor tooling. `<changefreq>` is NOT emitted — it is ignored by
 * everyone and asserts a cadence nobody here controls.

 *
 * THE ORDERING IS INTENT, NOT SIZE, and the two biggest sections make the point:
 * `hstack` (24 pages) and `development` document how to hack on KAIWU rather
 * than how to use it, so they sit at the bottom; `getting-started` (5 pages)
 * sits at the top because it is where a stranger lands. `agents` is second only
 * to that — "does it run <my agent>" is the question most searches are actually
 * asking.
 *
 * These keys track the CURRENT information architecture (the /providers → /agents
 * reorganisation). A section renamed without updating this table does not break
 * anything: it silently falls back to DEFAULT_PRIORITY, which is why the
 * fallback is a middling value rather than a low one.
