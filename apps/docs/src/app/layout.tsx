/**
 * The marketing site's three families, from the site's own variable woff2 files.
 *
 * This replaced three separate Inter TTFs (Regular/Italic/SemiBold, ~1.2 MB
 * together) that carried no display or mono face. One variable file per family
 * covers the whole weight axis, and the three together are ~122 KB — so the
 * docs gained Inter Tight for headings and JetBrains Mono for code while
 * shedding about a megabyte.
 *
 * Exposed as CSS variables and consumed in global.css, so the type stack is
 * declared in one place next to the colour tokens it belongs with.
