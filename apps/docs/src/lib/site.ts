/**
 * Canonical identity for the documentation site.
 *
 * Everything that needs an absolute URL or the site's own name reads this, so
 * there is one place to change when the origin moves. This mirrors the guides
 * site's `src/lib/site.ts` deliberately — the two Next apps are siblings and
 * diverging on something this basic is how a preview build ends up publishing
 * production URLs.
 *
 * Why this file exists at all: without a `metadataBase`, Next resolves the
 * root-relative `openGraph.images` path against its own `http://localhost:3000`
 * fallback and bakes that into every prerendered page. Every share to Slack,
 * Discord, X or iMessage then renders a broken card.
