/**
 * Product analytics for docs.happier.dev.
 *
 * This is the marketing site's analytics module (apps/website/src/analytics)
 * reduced to what a documentation site needs, and it keeps every one of that
 * module's promises. Read the long header there for the reasoning; the short
 * version, because the privacy policy now states all of it as fact:
 *
 *   - cookieless_mode: 'always'. No cookie, no stored visitor id, no profile
 *     that survives a page load. This is what lets the policy say the sites set
 *     nothing on your device except your own refusal.
 *   - Do Not Track and Global Privacy Control are checked BEFORE init, so a
 *     browser that refuses is never even loaded into.
 *   - api_host is a path on this origin. The `/ingest` route handler forwards to
 *     PostHog EU, so the page makes no third-party request.
 *   - No session recording, no surveys, no autocapture, no feature-flag round
 *     trip. A docs page has nothing behind a flag and nothing worth replaying.
 *
 * REGION IS A COMPILE-TIME CONSTANT. PostHog Cloud US and EU are separate
 * deployments and a key from one is not valid in the other; posting to the wrong
 * host loses the event silently. Project 129992 is EU. apps/ui shipped with a US
 * fallback for exactly this reason and lost data until it was corrected.
