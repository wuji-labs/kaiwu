/**
 * Mounts a long row list across a few frames instead of all at once.
 *
 * Row virtualization is the usual answer, but it is the one thing this renderer
 * can't have: the pinned gutter and the horizontal scroll both rely on every
 * row of a file living in one container, and turning rows into list items
 * breaks them. Filling the list progressively buys most of the same win — the
 * first frame paints a screenful, the rest arrives over the next few frames —
 * while leaving the layout untouched.
 *
 * Short lists (the chat-sized diffs, which is most of them) skip the machinery
 * entirely and keep the caller's array identity, so nothing re-renders.
 *
 * Chunks are scheduled with `setTimeout`, deliberately not with
 * `requestAnimationFrame`: a backgrounded tab stops firing frames entirely, and
 * a fill that stalls there leaves the file silently truncated with no way to ask
 * for the rest. Timers are throttled in the background rather than stopped, so
 * the list always finishes.
